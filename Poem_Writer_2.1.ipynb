below:  \\nFor we brought them all aboard,  \\nAnd they blest him in their pain, that they were not left to Spain,         \\nTo the thumb-screw and the stake, for the glory of the Lord.', 'IV\\n\\nHe

roar’d a hurrah and so  \\nThe little Revenge ran on sheer into the heart of the foe,  \\nWith her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below;  \\nFor half of their fleet to the right and half to the left were seen,         \\nAnd the little Revenge ran on thro’ the long sea-lane between.', 'VI\\n\\nThousands of their soldiers look’d down from their decks and laugh’d,  \\nThousands of

dressing it suddenly dead,  \\nAnd himself he was wounded again in the side and the head,  \\nAnd he said, “Fight on!', 'fight on!”  \\n \\nXI\\n\\nAnd the night went down, and the sun smiled out far over the summer sea,        \\nAnd the Spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring;  \\nBut they dared not touch us again, for they fear’d that we still could sting,  \\nSo they watch’d what the end would be.', 'And we had not fought them in vain,  \\nBut in perilous plight were we,         \\nSeeing forty of our poor hundred were slain,  \\nAnd half of the rest of us maim’d for life

of it spent;\\nAnd the masts and the rigging were lying over the side;  \\nBut Sir Richard cried in his English pride:  \\n“We have fought such a fight for a day and a night  \\nAs may never be fought again!', 'We have won great glory, my men!', 'And a day less or more  \\nAt sea or ashore,  \\nWe die—does it matter when?', 'Sink me the ship, Master Gunner—sink her, split her in twain!', 'Fall into

courtly foreign grace;  \\nBut he rose upon their decks, and he cried:         \\n“I have fought for Queen and Faith like a valiant man and true;  \\nI have only done my duty as a man is bound to do.', 'With a joyful spirit I Sir Richard Grenville die!”  \\nAnd he fell upon their decks, and he died.', 'XIV\\n\\nAnd they stared at the dead that had been so valiant and true,         \\nAnd had holden the power and glory of Spain so cheap  \\nThat he dared her with one little ship and his English few;  \\nWas he devil or man?', 'He was devil for aught they knew,  \\nBut they sank his body with honor down into the deep.', 'And they mann’d the Revenge with a swarthier alien crew,         \\nAnd away she sail’d with her loss and long’d for her own;  \\nWhen a wind from the lands they had

grew,         \\nTill it smote on their hulls and their sails and their masts and their flags,  \\nAnd the whole sea plunged and fell on the shot-shatter’d navy of Spain,  \\nAnd the little Revenge

\\n\\nHow the Bishop of Norwich had bartered \\nHis faith for a legate's commission; \\nHow Lyndhurst, afraid to be martyr'd, \\nHad stooped to a base coalition; \\nHow Papists are cased from compassion \\nBy bigotry, stronger than steel; \\nHow burning would soon come in fashion, \\nAnd how very bad it must feel.\", 'We were all so much touched and excited \\nBy a subject so direly sublime, \\nThat the rules of politeness were slighted, \\nAnd we all of us talked at a time; \\nAnd in tones, which each moment grew louder, \\nTold how we should dress for the show, \\nAnd where we should fasten the powder, \\nAnd if we should bellow or no.', \"Thus from subject to subject we ran, \\nAnd the journey passed pleasantly o'er, \\nTill at last Dr Humdrum began; \\nFrom that time I remember no more.\", \"At Ware he commenced his prelection, \\nIn the dullest of clerical drones; \\nAnd when next I regained recollection \\nWe were rambling o'er Trumpington stones.\", \"Hark, news,

but new injuries ; \\nHer breath like to the juice in Tænarus, \\nThat blasts the springs, though ne'er so prosperous ; \\nHer hands, I know not how, used more to spill \\nThe food of others than herself to fill ; \\nBut O !\", \"her mind, that Orcus, which includes \\nLegions of mischiefs, countless multitudes \\nOf formless curses, projects unmade up, \\nAbuses yet unfashion'd, thoughts
