      "Before the King, but smiling took\n",
      "His hands in hands that nowise shook;\n",

      "One of his fathers' images\n",
      "Stand glad before him in a dream.\n",
      "Then down beside the bubbling stream\n",
      "They sat together, and the King\n",

      "Within the cup that thou must drink.\n",
      "Good is it that thou shalt not shrink\n",
      "From either: that the afterdays\n",
      "Shall still win glory from thy praise\n",

      "He ceased but his old lips moved still,\n",
      "As though they would the tale fulfil\n",

      "An oaken wreath was round his head\n",

      "Spake softly in his ear: and so\n",
      "The word from this to that did go,\n",
      "With laughing that seemed nowise good\n",
      "Unto the dweller of the wood,\n",

      "\n",
      "The Highwayman poem tells the story of an unnamed highwayman who was in love with Bess, a landlord's daughter. Betrayed to the authorities by Tim, a jealous ostler, the highwayman escapes ambush when Bess sacrifices her life to warn him. Learning of her death, he dies in a futile attempt at revenge, shot down on the highway. In the final stanza, the ghosts of the lovers meet again on winter nights. This poem is reputed to be the best narrative poem of all time for oral delivery.\n",
      "The poem makes effective use of vivid imagery for the background and of repetitious phrases to create the sense of a horseman riding at ease through the rural darkness to a lovers' tryst or of soldiers marching down the same road to ambush him. Almost half a century later, Noyes wrote, \"I think the success of the poem... was because it was not an artificial composition, but was written at an age when I was genuinely excited by that kind of romantic story\".\n",

      "But swift as dreams, myself I found\n",
      "Within the pilot's boat.\n",
      "Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,\n",
      "The boat spun round and round;\n",
      "And all was still, save that the hill\n",
      "Was telling of the sound.\n",
      "I moved my lips--the pilot shrieked\n",
      "And fell down in a fit;\n",

      "And prayed where he did sit.\n",
      "I took the oars: the pilot's boy,\n",
      "Who now doth crazy go,\n",
      "Laughed loud and long, and all the while\n",
