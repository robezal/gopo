0,Thomas Gray,Elegy Written In A Country Churchyard,"The Curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,
The plowman homeward plods his weary way,
And leaves the world to darkness and to me.

Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,
And all the air a solemn stillness holds,
Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,
And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;

Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r
The moping owl does to the moon complain
Of such as, wand'ring near her secret bow'r,
Molest her ancient solitary reign.

Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,
Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,
Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,
The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.

The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,
The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed,
The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,
No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.

For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,
Or busy housewife ply her evening care:
No children run to lisp their sire's return,
Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.

Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,
Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke:
How jocund did they drive their team afield!
How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!

Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,
Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;
Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
The short and simple annals of the poor.

The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r,
And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,
Awaits alike th' inevitable hour:
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.

Nor you, ye Proud, impute to These the fault,
If Memory o'er their Tomb no Trophies raise,
Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault
The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.

Can storied urn or animated bust
Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?
Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,
Or Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of death?

Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid
Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;
Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,
Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre.

But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page
Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll;
Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage,
And froze the genial current of the soul.

Full many a gem of purest ray serene
The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:
Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.

Some village Hampden that with dauntless breast
The little tyrant of his fields withstood,
Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,
Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.

Th' applause of list'ning senates to command,
The threats of pain and ruin to despise,
To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,
And read their history in a nation's eyes,

Their lot forbade: nor circumscribed alone
Their glowing virtues, but their crimes confined;
Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,
And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,

The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,
To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,
Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride
With incense kindled at the Muse's flame.

Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,
Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;
Along the cool sequester'd vale of life
They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.

Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect
Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,
The place of fame and elegy supply:
And many a holy text around she strews,
That teach the rustic moralist to die.

For who, to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind?

On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
Ev'n in our Ashes live their wonted Fires.

For thee, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead,
Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;
If chance, by lonely contemplation led,
Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,

Haply some hoary-headed Swain may say,
'Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
Brushing with hasty steps the dews away
To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech
That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
And pore upon the brook that babbles by.

'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,
Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,
Or crazed with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.

'One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;
Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;

'The next with dirges due in sad array
Slow through the church-way path we saw him borne.
Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay
Graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn:'

THE EPITAPH

Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth
A Youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.
Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.

Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.

No farther seek his merits to disclose,
Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
(There they alike in trembling hope repose,)
The bosom of his Father and his God.",Elegy
1,Dylan Thomas,Elegy,"Too proud to die; broken and blind he died
The darkest way, and did not turn away,
A cold kind man brave in his narrow pride

On that darkest day, Oh, forever may
He lie lightly, at last, on the last, crossed
Hill, under the grass, in love, and there grow

Young among the long flocks, and never lie lost
Or still all the numberless days of his death, though
Above all he longed for his mother's breast

Which was rest and dust, and in the kind ground
The darkest justice of death, blind and unblessed.
Let him find no rest but be fathered and found,

I prayed in the crouching room, by his blind bed,
In the muted house, one minute before
Noon, and night, and light. the rivers of the dead

Veined his poor hand I held, and I saw
Through his unseeing eyes to the roots of the sea.
(An old tormented man three-quarters blind,

I am not too proud to cry that He and he
Will never never go out of my mind.
All his bones crying, and poor in all but pain,

Being innocent, he dreaded that he died
Hating his God, but what he was was plain:
An old kind man brave in his burning pride.

The sticks of the house were his; his books he owned.
Even as a baby he had never cried;
Nor did he now, save to his secret wound.

Out of his eyes I saw the last light glide.
Here among the liught of the lording sky
An old man is with me where I go

Walking in the meadows of his son's eye
On whom a world of ills came down like snow.
He cried as he died, fearing at last the spheres'

Last sound, the world going out without a breath:
Too proud to cry, too frail to check the tears,
And caught between two nights, blindness and death.

O deepest wound of all that he should die
On that darkest day. oh, he could hide
The tears out of his eyes, too proud to cry.

Until I die he will not leave my side.)",Elegy
2,Rainer Maria Rilke,Duino Elegies: The First Elegy,"Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angels'
hierarchies? and even if one of them suddenly
pressed me against his heart, I would perish
in the embrace of his stronger existence.
For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror
which we are barely able to endure and are awed
because it serenely disdains to annihilate us.
Each single angel is terrifying.
And so I force myself, swallow and hold back
the surging call of my dark sobbing.
Oh, to whom can we turn for help?
Not angels, not humans;
and even the knowing animals are aware that we feel
little secure and at home in our interpreted world.
There remains perhaps some tree on a hillside
daily for us to see; yesterday's street remains for us
stayed, moved in with us and showed no signs of leaving.
Oh, and the night, the night, when the wind
full of cosmic space invades our frightened faces.
Whom would it not remain for -that longed-after,
gently disenchanting night, painfully there for the
solitary heart to achieve? Is it easier for lovers?
Don't you know yet ? Fling out of your arms the 
emptiness into the spaces we breath -perhaps the birds
will feel the expanded air in their more ferven flight.

Yes, the springtime were in need of you. Often a star
waited for you to espy it and sense its light.
A wave rolled toward you out of the distant past,
or as you walked below an open window,
a violin gave itself to your hearing.
All this was trust. But could you manage it?
Were you not always distraught by expectation,
as if all this were announcing the arrival
of a beloved?  (Where would you find a place
to hide her, with all your great strange thoughts 
coming and going and often staying for the night.)
When longing overcomes you, sing of women in love;
for their famous passion is far from immortal enough.
Those whom you almost envy, the abandoned and
desolate ones, whom you found so much more loving
than those gratified. Begin ever new again
the praise you cannot attain; remember:
the hero lives on and survives; even his downfall
was for him only a pretext for achieving
his final birth. But nature, exhausted, takes lovers
back into itself, as if such creative forces could never be
achieved a second time.
Have you thought of Gaspara Stampa sufficiently:

that any girl abandoned by her lover may feel
from that far intenser example of loving:
""Ah, might I become like her!"" Should not their oldest
sufferings finally become more fruitful for us?
Is it not time that lovingly we freed ourselves
from the beloved and, quivering, endured:
as the arrow endures the bow-string's tension,
and in this tense release becomes more than itself.
For staying is nowhere.

Voices, voices. Listen my heart, as only saints
have listened: until the gigantic call lifted them
clear off the ground. Yet they went on, impossibly,
kneeling, completely unawares: so intense was
their listening. Not that you could endure
the voice of God -far from it! But listen
to the voice of the wind and the ceaseless message
that forms itself out of silence. They sweep
toward you now from those who died young.
Whenever they entered a church in Rome or Naples,
did not their fate quietly speak to you as recently
as the tablet did in Santa Maria Formosa?
What do they want of me? to quietly remove
the appearance of suffered injustice that,
at times, hinders a little their spirits from
freely proceeding onward.

Of course, it is strange to inhabit the earth no longer,
to no longer use skills on had barely time to acquire;
not to observe roses and other things that promised
so much in terms of a human future, no longer
to be what one was in infinitely anxious hands;
to even discard one's own name as easily as a child
abandons a broken toy.
Strange, not to desire to continue wishing one's wishes.
Strange to notice all that was related, fluttering
so loosely in space. And being dead is hard work
and full of retrieving before one can gradually feel a
trace of eternity. -Yes, but the liviing make
the mistake of drawing too sharp a distinction.
Angels (they say) are often unable to distinguish
between moving among the living or the dead.
The eternal torrent whirls all ages along with it,
through both realms forever, and their voices are lost in
its thunderous roar.

In the end the early departed have no longer
need of us. One is gently weaned from things
of this world as a child outgrows the need
of its mother's breast. But we who have need 
of those great mysteries, we for whom grief is
so often the source of spiritual growth,
could we exist without them?
Is the legend vain that tells of music's beginning
in the midst of the mourning for Linos?
the daring first sounds of song piercing
the barren numbness, and how in that stunned space
an almost godlike youth suddenly left forever,
and the emptiness felt for the first time
those harmonious vibrations which now enrapture
and comfort and help us.


Translated by Albert Ernest Flemming",Elegy
3,Theodore Roethke,Elegy For Jane,"(My student, thrown by a horse)

I remember the neckcurls, limp and damp as tendrils; 
And her quick look, a sidelong pickerel smile; 
And how, once started into talk, the light syllables leaped for her. 
And she balanced in the delight of her thought, 
A wren, happy, tail into the wind, 
Her song trembling the twigs and small branches. 
The shade sang with her; 
The leaves, their whispers turned to kissing, 
And the mould sang in the bleached valleys under the rose. 

Oh, when she was sad, she cast herself down into such a pure depth, 
Even a father could not find her: 
Scraping her cheek against straw, 
Stirring the clearest water. 
My sparrow, you are not here, 
Waiting like a fern, making a spiney shadow. 
The sides of wet stones cannot console me, 
Nor the moss, wound with the last light. 

If only I could nudge you from this sleep, 
My maimed darling, my skittery pigeon. 
Over this damp grave I speak the words of my love: 
I, with no rights in this matter, 
Neither father nor lover.",Elegy
4,Wilfred Owen,Elegy In April And September,"Hush, thrush! Hush, missen-thrush, I listen...
I heard the flush of footsteps through the loose leaves,
And a low whistle by the water's brim.

Still! Daffodil! Nay, hail me not so gaily,-
Your gay gold lily daunts me and deceives,
Who follow gleams more golden and more slim.

Look, brook! O run and look, O run!
The vain reeds shook? - Yet search till gray sea heaves,
And I will stray among these fields for him.

Gaze, daisy! Stare through haze and glare,
And mark the hazardous stars all dawns and eves,
For my eye withers, and his star wanes dim.

Close, rose, and droop, heliotrope,
And shudder, hope! The shattering winter blows.
Drop, heliotrope, and close, rose...

Mourn, corn, and sigh, rye.
Men garner you, but youth's head lies forlorn.
Sigh, rye, and mourn, corn...

Brood, wood, and muse, yews,
The ways gods use we have not understood.
Muse, yews, and brood, wood...",Elegy
5,Rainer Maria Rilke,Duino Elegies: The Tenth Elegy,"That some day, emerging at last from the terrifying vision
I may burst into jubilant praise to assenting angels!
That of the clear-struck keys of the heart not one may fail
to sound because of a loose, doubtful or broken string!
That my streaming countenance may make me more resplendent
That my humble weeping change into blossoms.
Oh, how will you then, nights of suffering, be remembered
with love. Why did I not kneel more fervently, disconsolate
sisters, more bendingly kneel to receive you, more loosely
surrender myself to your loosened hair? We, squanderers of
gazing beyond them to judge the end of their duration.
They are only our winter's foliage, our sombre evergreen,
one of the seasons of our interior year, -not only season,
but place, settlement, camp, soil and dwelling.

How woeful, strange, are the alleys of the City of Pain,
where in the false silence created from too much noise,
a thing cast out from the mold of emptiness
swaggers that gilded hubbub, the bursting memorial.
Oh, how completely an angel would stamp out their market
of solace, bounded by the church, bought ready for use:
as clean, disappointing and closed as a post office on Sunday.
Farther out, though, there are always the rippling edges
of the fair. Seasaws of freedom! High-divers and jugglers of zeal!
And the shooting-gallery's targets of bedizened happiness:
targets tumbling in tinny contortions whenever some better
marksman happens to hit one. From cheers to chance he goes
staggering on, as booths that can please the most curious tastes
are drumming and bawling. For adults ony there is something
special to see: how money multiplies. Anatomy made amusing!
Money's organs on view! Nothing concealed! Instructive,
and guaranteed to increase fertility!...

                                                            Oh, and then outside,
behind the farthest billboard, pasted with posters for 'Deathless,'
that bitter beer tasting quite sweet to drinkers,
if they chew fresh diversions with it..
Behind the billboard, just in back of it, life is real.
Children play, and lovers hold each other, -aside,
earnestly, in the trampled grass, and dogs respond to nature.
The youth continues onward; perhaps he is in love with
a young Lament....he follows her into the meadows.
She says: the way is long. We live out there....
                                                        Where? And the youth
follows. He is touched by her gentle bearing. The shoulders,
the neck, -perhaps she is of noble ancestry? 
Yet he leaves her, turns around, looks back and waves...
What could come of it? She is a Lament.

Only those who died young, in their first state of
timeless serenity, while they are being weaned,
follow her lovingly. She waits for girls
and befriends them. Gently she shows them
what she is wearing. Pearls of grief
and the fine-spun veils of patience.-
With youths she walks in silence.

But there, where they live, in the valley,
an elderly Lament responds to the youth as he asks:-
We were once, she says, a great race, we Laments.
Our fathers worked the mines up there in the mountains;
sometimes among men you will find a piece of polished
primeval pain, or a petrified slag from an ancient volcano.
Yes, that came from there. Once we were rich.-

And she leads him gently through the vast landscape
of Lamentation, shows him the columns of temples,
the ruins of strongholds from which long ago
the princes of Lament wisely governed the country.
Shows him the tall trees of tears,
the fields of flowering sadness,
(the living know them only as softest foliage);
show him the beasts of mourning, grazing-
and sometimes a startled bird, flying straight through
their field of vision, far away traces the image of its
solitary cry.-
At evening she leads him to the graves of elders
of the race of Lamentation, the sybils and prophets.
With night approaching, they move more softly,
and soon there looms ahead, bathed in moonlight,
the sepulcher, that all-guarding ancient stone,
Twin-brother to that on the Nile, the lofty Sphinx-:
the silent chamber's countenance.
They marvel at the regal head that has, forever silent,
laid the features of manking upon the scales of the stars.
His sight, still blinded by his early death,
cannot grasp it. But the Sphinx's gaze
frightens an owl from the rim of the double-crown.
The bird, with slow down-strokes, brushes
along the cheek, that with the roundest curve, 
and faintly inscribes on the new death-born hearing,
as though on the double page of an opened book,
the indescribable outline.

And higher up, the stars. New ones. Stars
of the land of pain. Slowly she names them:
""There, look: the Rider ,the Staff,and that 
crowded constellation they call the the Garland of Fruit.
Then farther up toward the Pole:
Cradle, Way, the Burning Book, Doll, Window.
And in the Southern sky, pure as lines
on the palm of a blessed hand, the clear sparkling M,
standing for Mothers.....""

Yet the dead  youth must go on alone.
In silence the elder Lament brings him
as far as the gorge where it shimmers in the moonlight:
The Foutainhead of Joy. With reverance she names it,
saying: ""In the world of mankind it is a life-bearing stream.""

They reach the foothills of the mountain,
and there she embraces him, weeping.

Alone, he climbs the mountains of primeval pain.
Not even his footsteps ring from this soundless fate.

But were these timeless dead to awaken an image for us,
see, they might be pointing to th catkins, hanging
from the leafless hazels, or else they might mean
the rain that falls upon the dark earth in early Spring.

And we, who always think
of happiness as rising feel the emotion
that almost overwhelms us
whenever a happy thing falls.


Translated by Albert Ernest Flemming",Elegy
6,Rainer Maria Rilke,Duino Elegies: The Fourth Elegy,"O trees of life, oh, what when winter comes?
We are not of one mind. Are not like birds
in unison migrating. And overtaken,
overdue, we thrust ourselves into the wind
and fall to earth into indifferent ponds.
Blossoming and withering we comprehend as one.
And somewhere lions roam, quite unaware,
in their magnificence, of any weaknesss.

But we, while wholly concentrating on one thing,
already feel the pressure of another.
Hatred is our first response. And lovers,
are they not forever invading one another's
boundaries? -although they promised space,
hunting and homeland. Then, for a sketch
drawn at a moment's impulse, a ground of contrast
is prepared, painfully, so that we may see.
For they are most exact with us. We do not know
the contours of our feelings. We only know 
what shapes them from the outside. 

Who has not sat, afraid, before his own heart's
curtain? It lifted and displayed the scenery
of departure. Easy to understand. The well-known
garden swaying just a little. Then came the dancer.
Not he! Enough! However lightly he pretends to move:
he is just disguised, costumed, an ordinary man
who enters through the kitchen when coming home.
I will not have these half-filled human masks;
better the puppet. It at least is full.
I will endure this well-stuffed doll, the wire,
the face that is nothing but appearance. Here out front
I wait. Even if the lights go down and I am told:
""There's nothing  more to come,"" -even if
the grayish drafts of emptiness come drifting down
from the deserted stage -even if not one
of my now silent forebears sist beside me
any longer, not a woman, not even a boy-
he with the brown and squinting eyes-:
I'll still remain. For one can always watch.

Am I not right?  You, to whom life would taste
so bitter, Father, after you - for my sake -
slipped of mine, that first muddy infusion
of my necessity. You kept on tasting, Father,
as I kept on growing, troubled by the aftertaste
of my so strange a future as you kept searching
my unfocused gaze -you who, so often since
you died, have been afraid for my well-being,
within my deepest hope, relinquishing that calmness,
the realms of equanimity such as the dead possess
for my so small fate -Am I not right?

And you, my parents, am I not right? You who loved me
for that small beginning of my love for you
from which I always shyly turned away, because
the distance in your features grew, changed,
even while I loved it, into cosmic space
where you no longer were...: and when I feel
inclined to wait before the puppet stage, no,
rather to stare at is so intensely that in the end
to counter-balance my searching gaze, an angel
has to come as an actor, and begin manipulating
the lifeless bodies of the puppets to perform.
Angel and puppet! Now at last there is a play!
Then what we seperate can come together by our
very presence. And only then the entire cycle
of our own life-seasons is revealed and set in motion.
Above, beyond us, the angel plays. Look:
must not the dying notice how unreal, how full
of pretense is all that we accomplish here, where
nothing is to be itself. O hours of childhood,
when behind each shape more that the past lay hidden,
when that which lay before us was not the future.

We grew, of course, and sometimes were impatient
in growing up,  half for the sake of pleasing those
with nothing left but their own grown-upness.
Yet, when alone, we entertained ourselves
with what alone endures, we would stand there
in the infinite space that spans the world and toys,
upon a place, which from the first beginnniing
had been prepared to serve a pure event.

Who shows a child just as it stands? Who places him
within his constellation, with the measuring-rod
of distance in his hand. Who makes his death
from gray bread that grows hard, -or leaves
it there inside his rounded mouth, jagged as the core
of a sweet apple?.......The minds of murderers
are easily comprehended. But this: to contain death,
the whole of death, even before life has begun,
to hold it all so gently within oneself,
and not be angry: that is indescribable.


Translated by Albert Ernest Flemming",Elegy
7,Alexander Pope,Elegy To The Memory Of An Unfortunate Lady,"What beck'ning ghost, along the moon-light shade
Invites my steps, and points to yonder glade?
'Tis she!--but why that bleeding bosom gor'd,
Why dimly gleams the visionary sword?
Oh ever beauteous, ever friendly! tell,
Is it, in heav'n, a crime to love too well?
To bear too tender, or too firm a heart,
To act a lover's or a Roman's part?
Is there no bright reversion in the sky,
For those who greatly think, or bravely die?

Why bade ye else, ye pow'rs! her soul aspire
Above the vulgar flight of low desire?
Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes;
The glorious fault of angels and of gods;
Thence to their images on earth it flows,
And in the breasts of kings and heroes glows.
Most souls, 'tis true, but peep out once an age,
Dull sullen pris'ners in the body's cage:
Dim lights of life, that burn a length of years
Useless, unseen, as lamps in sepulchres;
Like eastern kings a lazy state they keep,
And close confin'd to their own palace, sleep.

From these perhaps (ere nature bade her die)
Fate snatch'd her early to the pitying sky.
As into air the purer spirits flow,
And sep'rate from their kindred dregs below;
So flew the soul to its congenial place,
Nor left one virtue to redeem her race.

But thou, false guardian of a charge too good,
Thou, mean deserter of thy brother's blood!
See on these ruby lips the trembling breath,
These cheeks now fading at the blast of death:
Cold is that breast which warm'd the world before,
And those love-darting eyes must roll no more.
Thus, if eternal justice rules the ball,
Thus shall your wives, and thus your children fall;
On all the line a sudden vengeance waits,
And frequent hearses shall besiege your gates.
There passengers shall stand, and pointing say,
(While the long fun'rals blacken all the way)
""Lo these were they, whose souls the furies steel'd,
And curs'd with hearts unknowing how to yield.
Thus unlamented pass the proud away,
The gaze of fools, and pageant of a day!
So perish all, whose breast ne'er learn'd to glow
For others' good, or melt at others' woe.""

What can atone (oh ever-injur'd shade!)
Thy fate unpitied, and thy rites unpaid?
No friend's complaint, no kind domestic tear
Pleas'd thy pale ghost, or grac'd thy mournful bier.
By foreign hands thy dying eyes were clos'd,
By foreign hands thy decent limbs compos'd,
By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd,
By strangers honour'd, and by strangers mourn'd!
What though no friends in sable weeds appear,
Grieve for an hour, perhaps, then mourn a year,
And bear about the mockery of woe
To midnight dances, and the public show?
What though no weeping loves thy ashes grace,
Nor polish'd marble emulate thy face?
What though no sacred earth allow thee room,
Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb?
Yet shall thy grave with rising flow'rs be drest,
And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast:
There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow,
There the first roses of the year shall blow;
While angels with their silver wings o'ershade
The ground, now sacred by thy reliques made.

So peaceful rests, without a stone, a name,
What once had beauty, titles, wealth, and fame.
How lov'd, how honour'd once, avails thee not,
To whom related, or by whom begot;
A heap of dust alone remains of thee,
'Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be!

Poets themselves must fall, like those they sung,
Deaf the prais'd ear, and mute the tuneful tongue.
Ev'n he, whose soul now melts in mournful lays,
Shall shortly want the gen'rous tear he pays;
Then from his closing eyes thy form shall part,
And the last pang shall tear thee from his heart,
Life's idle business at one gasp be o'er,
The Muse forgot, and thou belov'd no more!",Elegy
8,Wilfred Owen,An Imperial Elegy,"Not one corner of a foreign field
But a span as wide as Europe;
An appearance of a titan's grave,
And the length thereof a thousand miles,
It crossed all Europe like a mystic road,
Or as the Spirits' Pathway lieth on the night.
And I heard a voice crying
This is the Path of Glory.",Elegy
9,John Donne,Elegy Xix: To His Mistress Going To Bed,"Come, madam, come, all rest my powers defy,
Until I labor, I in labor lie.
The foe oft-times having the foe in sight,
Is tired with standing though he never fight.
Off with that girdle, like heaven's zone glistering,
But a far fairer world encompassing.
Unpin that spangled breastplate which you wear,
That th' eyes of busy fools may be stopped there.
Unlace yourself, for that harmonious chime
Tells me from you that now it is bed time.
Off with that happy busk, which I envy,
That still can be, and still can stand so nigh.
Your gown, going off, such beauteous state reveals,
As when from flowry meads th' hill's shadow steals.
Off with that wiry coronet and show
The hairy diadem which on you doth grow:
Now off with those shoes, and then safely tread
In this love's hallowed temple, this soft bed.
In such white robes, heaven's angels used to be
Received by men; thou, Angel, bring'st with thee
A heaven like Mahomet's Paradise; and though
Ill spirits walk in white, we easily know
By this these angels from an evil sprite:
Those set our hairs, but these our flesh upright. 

License my roving hands, and let them go 
Before, behind, between, above, below.
O my America! my new-found-land,
My kingdom, safeliest when with one man manned,
My mine of precious stones, my empery,
How blest am I in this discovering of thee!
To enter in these bonds is to be free;
Then where my hand is set, my seal shall be.

Full nakedness! All joys are due to thee, 
As souls unbodied, bodies unclothed must be
To taste whole joys. Gems which you women use
Are like Atlanta's balls, cast in men's views,
That when a fools' eye lighteth on a gem,
His earthly soul may covet theirs, not them.
Like pictures, or like books' gay coverings made
For lay-men, are all women thus arrayed;
Themselves are mystic books, which only we
(Whom their imputed grace will dignify)
Must see revealed. Then, since that I may know,
As liberally as to a midwife, show
Thyself: cast all, yea, this white linen hence,
There is no penance due to innocence. 
To teach thee, I am naked first; why than, 
What needst thou have more covering than a man?",Elegy
10,Rainer Maria Rilke,Elegy I,"Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angels'
hierarchies? and even if one of them suddenly
pressed me against his heart, I would perish
in the embrace of his stronger existence.
For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror
which we are barely able to endure and are awed
because it serenely disdains to annihilate us.
Each single angel is terrifying.
And so I force myself, swallow and hold back
the surging call of my dark sobbing.
Oh, to whom can we turn for help?
Not angels, not humans;
and even the knowing animals are aware that we feel
little secure and at home in our interpreted world.
There remains perhaps some tree on a hillside
daily for us to see; yesterday's street remains for us
stayed, moved in with us and showed no signs of leaving.
Oh, and the night, the night, when the wind
full of cosmic space invades our frightened faces.
Whom would it not remain for -that longed-after,
gently disenchanting night, painfully there for the
solitary heart to achieve? Is it easier for lovers?
Don't you know yet ? Fling out of your arms the 
emptiness into the spaces we breath -perhaps the birds
will feel the expanded air in their more ferven flight.

Yes, the springtime were in need of you. Often a star
waited for you to espy it and sense its light.
A wave rolled toward you out of the distant past,
or as you walked below an open window,
a violin gave itself to your hearing.
All this was trust. But could you manage it?
Were you not always distraught by expectation,
as if all this were announcing the arrival
of a beloved? (Where would you find a place
to hide her, with all your great strange thoughts 
coming and going and often staying for the night.)
When longing overcomes you, sing of women in love;
for their famous passion is far from immortal enough.
Those whom you almost envy, the abandoned and
desolate ones, whom you found so much more loving
than those gratified. Begin ever new again
the praise you cannot attain; remember:
the hero lives on and survives; even his downfall
was for him only a pretext for achieving
his final birth. But nature, exhausted, takes lovers
back into itself, as if such creative forces could never be
achieved a second time.
Have you thought of Gaspara Stampa sufficiently:

that any girl abandoned by her lover may feel
from that far intenser example of loving:
""Ah, might I become like her!"" Should not their oldest
sufferings finally become more fruitful for us?
Is it not time that lovingly we freed ourselves
from the beloved and, quivering, endured:
as the arrow endures the bow-string's tension,
and in this tense release becomes more than itself.
For staying is nowhere.

Voices, voices. Listen my heart, as only saints
have listened: until the gigantic call lifted them
clear off the ground. Yet they went on, impossibly,
kneeling, completely unawares: so intense was
their listening. Not that you could endure
the voice of God -far from it! But listen
to the voice of the wind and the ceaseless message
that forms itself out of silence. They sweep
toward you now from those who died young.
Whenever they entered a church in Rome or Naples,
did not their fate quietly speak to you as recently
as the tablet did in Santa Maria Formosa?
What do they want of me? to quietly remove
the appearance of suffered injustice that,
at times, hinders a little their spirits from
freely proceeding onward.

Of course, it is strange to inhabit the earth no longer,
to no longer use skills on had barely time to acquire;
not to observe roses and other things that promised
so much in terms of a human future, no longer
to be what one was in infinitely anxious hands;
to even discard one's own name as easily as a child
abandons a broken toy.
Strange, not to desire to continue wishing one's wishes.
Strange to notice all that was related, fluttering
so loosely in space. And being dead is hard work
and full of retrieving before one can gradually feel a
trace of eternity. -Yes, but the liviing make
the mistake of drawing too sharp a distinction.
Angels (they say) are often unable to distinguish
between moving among the living or the dead.
The eternal torrent whirls all ages along with it,
through both realms forever, and their voices are lost in
its thunderous roar.

In the end the early departed have no longer
need of us. One is gently weaned from things
of this world as a child outgrows the need
of its mother's breast. But we who have need 
of those great mysteries, we for whom grief is
so often the source of spiritual growth,
could we exist without them?
Is the legend vain that tells of music's beginning
in the midst of the mourning for Linos?
the daring first sounds of song piercing
the barren numbness, and how in that stunned space
an almost godlike youth suddenly left forever,
and the emptiness felt for the first time
those harmonious vibrations which now enrapture
and comfort and help us.",Elegy
11,Jonathan Swift,A Satirical Elegy On The Death Of A Late..,"""His Grace! impossible! what, dead!
Of old age too, and in his bed!
And could that mighty warrior fall,
And so inglorious, after all?
Well, since he's gone, no matter how,
The last loud trump must wake him now;
And, trust me, as the noise grows stronger,
He'd wish to sleep a little longer.
And could he be indeed so old
As by the newspapers we're told?
Threescore, I think, is pretty high;
'Twas time in conscience he should die!
This world he cumber'd long enough;
He burnt his candle to the snuff;
And that's the reason, some folks think,
He left behind so great a stink.
Behold his funeral appears,
Nor widows' sighs, nor orphans' tears,
Wont at such times each heart to pierce,
Attend the progress of his hearse.
But what of that? his friends may say,
He had those honours in his day.
True to his profit and his pride,
He made them weep before he died

Come hither, all ye empty things!
Ye bubbles rais'd by breath of kings!
Who float upon the tide of state;
Come hither, and behold your fate!
Let pride be taught by this rebuke,
How very mean a thing's a duke;
From all his ill-got honours flung,
Turn'd to that dirt from whence he sprung""",Elegy
12,Lawrence Ferlinghetti,An Elegy On The Death Of Kenneth Patchen,"A poet is born
A poet dies
And all that lies between
is us
and the world

And the world lies about it
making as if it had got his message
even though it is poetry
but most of the world wishing
it could just forget about him
and his awful strange prophecies


Along with all the other strange things
he said about the world
which were all too true
and which made them fear him
more than they loved him
though he spoke much of love

Along with all the alarms he sounded
which turned out to be false
if only for the moment
all of which made them fear his tongue
more than they loved him
Though he spoke much of love
and never lived by ‘silence exile &amp; cunning’ 
and was a loud conscientious objector to
the deaths we daily give each other
though we speak much of love


And when such a one dies
even the agents of Death should take note 
and shake the shit from their wings
in Air Force One
But they do not
And the shit still flies
And the poet now is disconnected
and won’t call back
though he spoke much of love

And still we hear him say
‘Do I not deal with angels
when her lips I touch’
And still we hear him say
‘0 my darling troubles heaven
with her loveliness’
And still we hear him say
‘As we are so wonderfully done with each other 
We can walk into our separate ‘sleep
On floors of music where the milkwhite cloak 
of childhood lies’

And still we hear him saying
‘Therefore the constant powers do not lessen 
Nor is the property of the spirit scattered 
on the cold hills of these events’
And still we hear him asking
‘Do the dead know what time it is?’

He is gone under
He is scattered
undersea
and knows what time
but won’t be back to tell it
He would be too proud to call back anyway
And too full of strange laughter
to speak to us anymore anyway

And the weight of human experience
lies upon the world
like the chains of the ‘sea
in which he sings
And he swings in the tides of the sea
And his ashes are washed
in the ides of the sea
And ‘an astonished eye looks out of the air’
to see the poet singing there

And dusk falls down a coast somewhere

where a white horse without a rider
turns its head
to the sea",Elegy
13,Anne Sexton,Elegy In The Classroom,"In the thin classroom, where your face
was noble and your words were all things,
I find this boily creature in your place;

find you disarranged, squatting on the window sill,
irrefutably placed up there,
like a hunk of some big frog
watching us through the V
of your woolen legs.

Even so, I must admire your skill.
You are so gracefully insane.
We fidget in our plain chairs
and pretend to catalogue
our facts for your burly sorcery

or ignore your fat blind eyes
or the prince you ate yesterday
who was wise, wise, wise.",Elegy
14,Oliver Goldsmith,An Elegy On The Death Of A Mad Dog,"Good people all, of every sort,
Give ear unto my song; 
And if you find it wondrous short,
It cannot hold you long.

In Islington there was a man
Of whom the world might say,
That still a godly race he ran— 
Whene'er he went to pray.

A kind and gentle heart he had,
To comfort friends and foes; 
The naked every day he clad— 
When he put on his clothes.

And in that town a dog was found,
As many dogs there be,
Both mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound,
And curs of low degree.

This dog and man at first were friends; 
But when a pique began,
The dog, to gain some private ends,
Went mad, and bit the man.

Around from all the neighbouring streets
The wond'ring neighbours ran,
And swore the dog had lost its wits
To bite so good a man.

The wound it seemed both sore and sad
To every Christian eye; 
And while they swore the dog was mad,
They swore the man would die.

But soon a wonder came to light
That showed the rogues they lied,— 
The man recovered of the bite,
The dog it was that died!",Elegy
15,John Donne,Elegy Xvi: On His Mistress,"By our first strange and fatal interview,
By all desires which thereof did ensue,
By our long starving hopes, by that remorse
Which my words' masculine persuasive force
Begot in thee, and by the memory
Of hurts, which spies and rivals threatened me,
I calmly beg: but by thy father's wrath,
By all pains, which want and divorcement hath,
I conjure thee, and all the oaths which I
And thou have sworn to seal joint constancy,
Here I unswear, and overswear them thus,
Thou shalt not love by ways so dangerous.
Temper, O fair Love, love's impetuous rage,
Be my true Mistress still, not my feigned Page;
I'll go, and, by thy kind leave, leave behind
Thee, only worthy to nurse in my mind
Thirst to come back; O if thou die before,
My soul from other lands to thee shall soar.
Thy (else Almighty) beauty cannot move
Rage from the Seas, nor thy love teach them love,
Nor tame wild Boreas' harshness; thou hast read
How roughly he in pieces shivered
Fair Orithea, wbom he swore he loved.
Fall ill or good, 'tis madness to have proved
Dangers unurged; feed on this flattery,
That absent Lovers one in th' other be.
Dissemble nothing, not a boy, nor change
Thy body's habit, nor mind's; be not strange
To thyself only; all will spy in thy face
A blushing womanly discovering grace;
Ricbly clothed Apes are called Apes, and as soon
Eclipsed as bright we call the Moon the Moon.
Men of France, changeable chameleons,
Spitals of diseases, shops of fashions,
Love's fuellers, and the rightest company
Of Players, which upon the world's stage be,
Will quickly know thee, and no less, alas!
Th' indifferent Italian, as we pass
His warm land, well content to think thee Page,
Will hunt thee with such lust, and hideous rage,
As Lot's fair guests were vexed. But none of these
Nor spongy hydroptic Dutch shall thee displease,
If thou stay here. O stay here, for, for thee
England is only a worthy gallery,
To walk in expectation, till from thence
Our greatest King call thee to his presence.
When I am gone, dream me some happiness,
Nor let thy looks our long-hid love confess,
Nor praise, nor dispraise me, nor bless nor curse
Openly love's force, nor in bed fright thy Nurse
With midnight's startings, crying out—oh, oh
Nurse, O my love is slain, I saw him go
O'er the white Alps alone; I saw him, I,
Assailed, fight, taken, stabbed, bleed, fall, and die.
Augur me better chance, except dread Jove
Think it enough for me t' have had thy love.",Elegy
16,John Donne,Elegy Xviii: Love's Progress,"Who ever loves, if he do not propose
The right true end of love, he's one that goes
To sea for nothing but to make him sick.
Love is a bear-whelp born: if we o'erlick
Our love, and force it new strange shapes to take,
We err, and of a lump a monster make.
Were not a calf a monster that were grown
Faced like a man, though better than his own?
Perfection is in unity: prefer
One woman first, and then one thing in her.
I, when I value gold, may think upon
The ductileness, the application,
The wholsomeness, the ingenuity,
From rust, from soil, from fire ever free;
But if I love it, 'tis because 'tis made
By our new nature (Use) the soul of trade.
All these in women we might think upon
(If women had them) and yet love but one.
Can men more injure women than to say
They love them for that by which they're not they?
Makes virtue woman? Must I cool my blood
Till I both be, and find one, wise and good?
May barren angels love so! But if we
Make love to woman, virtue is not she,
As beauty's not, nor wealth. He that strays thus
From her to hers is more adulterous
Than if he took her maid. Search every sphere
And firmament, our Cupid is not there;
He's an infernal god, and under ground
With Pluto dwells, where gold and fire abound:
Men to such gods their sacrificing coals
Did not in altars lay, but pits and holes.
Although we see celestial bodies move
Above the earth, the earth we till and love:
So we her airs contemplate, words and heart
And virtues, but we love the centric part.
Nor is the soul more worthy, or more fit,
For love than this, as infinite is it.
But in attaining this desired place
How much they err that set out at the face.
The hair a forest is of ambushes,
Of springs, snares, fetters and manacles;
The brow becalms us when 'tis smooth and plain,
And when 'tis wrinkled shipwrecks us again— 
Smooth, 'tis a paradise where we would have
Immortal stay, and wrinkled 'tis our grave.
The nose (like to the first meridian) runs
Not 'twixt an East and West, but 'twixt two suns;
It leaves a cheek, a rosy hemisphere,
On either side, and then directs us where
Upon the Islands Fortunate we fall,
(Not faint Canaries, but Ambrosial)
Her swelling lips; to which when we are come,
We anchor there, and think ourselves at home,
For they seem all: there Sirens' songs, and there
Wise Delphic oracles do fill the ear;
There in a creek where chosen pearls do swell,
The remora, her cleaving tongue doth dwell.
These, and the glorious promontory, her chin,
O'erpassed, and the straight Hellespont between
The Sestos and Abydos of her breasts,
(Not of two lovers, but two loves the nests)
Succeeds a boundless sea, but yet thine eye
Some island moles may scattered there descry;
And sailing towards her India, in that way
Shall at her fair Atlantic navel stay;
Though thence the current be thy pilot made,
Yet ere thou be where thou wouldst be embayed
Thou shalt upon another forest set,
Where many shipwreck and no further get.
When thou art there, consider what this chase
Misspent by thy beginning at the face.
Rather set out below; practise my art.
Some symetry the foot hath with that part
Which thou dost seek, and is thy map for that,
Lovely enough to stop, but not stay at;
Least subject to disguise and change it is— 
Men say the devil never can change his.
It is the emblem that hath figured
Firmness; 'tis the first part that comes to bed.
Civility we see refined; the kiss
Which at the face began, transplanted is,
Since to the hand, since to the imperial knee,
Now at the papal foot delights to be:
If kings think that the nearer way, and do
Rise from the foot, lovers may do so too;
For as free spheres move faster far than can
Birds, whom the air resists, so may that man
Which goes this empty and ethereal way,
Than if at beauty's elements he stay.
Rich nature hath in women wisely made
Two purses, and their mouths aversely laid:
They then which to the lower tribute owe
That way which that exchequer looks must go:
He which doth not, his error is as great
As who by clyster gave the stomach meat.",Elegy
17,Rainer Maria Rilke,Elegy X,"That some day, emerging at last from the terrifying vision
I may burst into jubilant praise to assenting angels!
That of the clear-struck keys of the heart not one may fail
to sound because of a loose, doubtful or broken string!
That my streaming countenance may make me more resplendent
That my humble weeping change into blossoms.
Oh, how will you then, nights of suffering, be remembered
with love. Why did I not kneel more fervently, disconsolate
sisters, more bendingly kneel to receive you, more loosely
surrender myself to your loosened hair? We, squanderers of
gazing beyond them to judge the end of their duration.
They are only our winter's foliage, our sombre evergreen,
one of the seasons of our interior year, -not only season,
but place, settlement, camp, soil and dwelling.

How woeful, strange, are the alleys of the City of Pain,
where in the false silence created from too much noise,
a thing cast out from the mold of emptiness
swaggers that gilded hubbub, the bursting memorial.
Oh, how completely an angel would stamp out their market
of solace, bounded by the church, bought ready for use:
as clean, disappointing and closed as a post office on Sunday.
Farther out, though, there are always the rippling edges
of the fair. Seasaws of freedom! High-divers and jugglers of zeal!
And the shooting-gallery's targets of bedizened happiness:
targets tumbling in tinny contortions whenever some better
marksman happens to hit one. From cheers to chance he goes
staggering on, as booths that can please the most curious tastes
are drumming and bawling. For adults ony there is something
special to see: how money multiplies. Anatomy made amusing!
Money's organs on view! Nothing concealed! Instructive,
and guaranteed to increase fertility!...

Oh, and then outside,
behind the farthest billboard, pasted with posters for 'Deathless,'
that bitter beer tasting quite sweet to drinkers,
if they chew fresh diversions with it..
Behind the billboard, just in back of it, life is real.
Children play, and lovers hold each other, -aside,
earnestly, in the trampled grass, and dogs respond to nature.
The youth continues onward; perhaps he is in love with
a young Lament....he follows her into the meadows.
She says: the way is long. We live out there....
Where? And the youth
follows. He is touched by her gentle bearing. The shoulders,
the neck, -perhaps she is of noble ancestry? 
Yet he leaves her, turns around, looks back and waves...
What could come of it? She is a Lament.

Only those who died young, in their first state of
timeless serenity, while they are being weaned,
follow her lovingly. She waits for girls
and befriends them. Gently she shows them
what she is wearing. Pearls of grief
and the fine-spun veils of patience.-
With youths she walks in silence.

But there, where they live, in the valley,
an elderly Lament responds to the youth as he asks:-
We were once, she says, a great race, we Laments.
Our fathers worked the mines up there in the mountains;
sometimes among men you will find a piece of polished
primeval pain, or a petrified slag from an ancient volcano.
Yes, that came from there. Once we were rich.-

And she leads him gently through the vast landscape
of Lamentation, shows him the columns of temples,
the ruins of strongholds from which long ago
the princes of Lament wisely governed the country.
Shows him the tall trees of tears,
the fields of flowering sadness,
(the living know them only as softest foliage);
show him the beasts of mourning, grazing-
and sometimes a startled bird, flying straight through
their field of vision, far away traces the image of its
solitary cry.-
At evening she leads him to the graves of elders
of the race of Lamentation, the sybils and prophets.
With night approaching, they move more softly,
and soon there looms ahead, bathed in moonlight,
the sepulcher, that all-guarding ancient stone,
Twin-brother to that on the Nile, the lofty Sphinx-:
the silent chamber's countenance.
They marvel at the regal head that has, forever silent,
laid the features of manking upon the scales of the stars.
His sight, still blinded by his early death,
cannot grasp it. But the Sphinx's gaze
frightens an owl from the rim of the double-crown.
The bird, with slow down-strokes, brushes
along the cheek, that with the roundest curve, 
and faintly inscribes on the new death-born hearing,
as though on the double page of an opened book,
the indescribable outline.

And higher up, the stars. New ones. Stars
of the land of pain. Slowly she names them:
""There, look: the Rider ,the Staff,and that 
crowded constellation they call the the Garland of Fruit.
Then farther up toward the Pole:
Cradle, Way, the Burning Book, Doll, Window.
And in the Southern sky, pure as lines
on the palm of a blessed hand, the clear sparkling M,
standing for Mothers.....""

Yet the dead youth must go on alone.
In silence the elder Lament brings him
as far as the gorge where it shimmers in the moonlight:
The Foutainhead of Joy. With reverance she names it,
saying: ""In the world of mankind it is a life-bearing stream.""

They reach the foothills of the mountain,
and there she embraces him, weeping.

Alone, he climbs the mountains of primeval pain.
Not even his footsteps ring from this soundless fate.

But were these timeless dead to awaken an image for us,
see, they might be pointing to th catkins, hanging
from the leafless hazels, or else they might mean
the rain that falls upon the dark earth in early Spring.

And we, who always think
of happiness as rising feel the emotion
that almost overwhelms us
whenever a happy thing falls.",Elegy
18,John Donne,Elegy I: Jealousy,"Fond woman, which wouldst have thy husband die,
And yet complain'st of his great jealousy;
If swol'n with poison, he lay in his last bed,
His body with a sere-bark covered,
Drawing his breath, as thick and short, as can
The nimblest crocheting musician,
Ready with loathsome vomiting to spew
His soul out of one hell, into a new,
Made deaf with his poor kindred's howling cries,
Begging with few feigned tears, great legacies,
Thou wouldst not weep, but jolly and frolic be,
As a slave, which tomorrow should be free;
Yet weep'st thou, when thou seest him hungerly
Swallow his own death, hearts-bane jealousy.
O give him many thanks, he's courteous,
That in suspecting kindly warneth us
Wee must not, as we used, flout openly,
In scoffing riddles, his deformity;
Nor at his board together being sat,
With words, nor touch, scarce looks adulterate;
Nor when he swol'n, and pampered with great fare
Sits down, and snorts, caged in his basket chair,
Must we usurp his own bed any more,
Nor kiss and play in his house, as before.
Now I see many dangers; for that is
His realm, his castle, and his diocese.
But if, as envious men, which would revile
Their Prince, or coin his gold, themselves exile
Into another country, and do it there,
We play in another house, what should we fear?
There we will scorn his houshold policies,
His seely plots, and pensionary spies,
As the inhabitants of Thames' right side
Do London's Mayor; or Germans, the Pope's pride.",Elegy
19,John Donne,Elegy X: The Dream,"Image of her whom I love, more than she,
Whose fair impression in my faithful heart
Makes me her medal, and makes her love me,
As Kings do coins, to which their stamps impart
The value: go, and take my heart from hence,
Which now is grown too great and good for me:
Honours oppress weak spirits, and our sense
Strong objects dull; the more, the less we see.

When you are gone, and Reason gone with you,
Then Fantasy is queen and soul, and all;
She can present joys meaner than you do;
Convenient, and more proportional.
So, if I dream I have you, I have you,
For, all our joys are but fantastical.
And so I 'scape the pain, for pain is true;
And sleep which locks up sense, doth lock out all.

After a such fruition I shall wake,
And, but the waking, nothing shall repent;
And shall to love more thankful sonnets make
Than if more honour, tears, and pains were spent.
But dearest heart, and dearer image, stay;
Alas, true joys at best are dream enough;
Though you stay here you pass too fast away:
For even at first life's taper is a snuff.

Filied with her love, may I be rather grown
Mad with much heart, than idiot with none.",Elegy
20,Rainer Maria Rilke,Elegy Iv,"O trees of life, oh, what when winter comes?
We are not of one mind. Are not like birds
in unison migrating. And overtaken,
overdue, we thrust ourselves into the wind
and fall to earth into indifferent ponds.
Blossoming and withering we comprehend as one.
And somewhere lions roam, quite unaware,
in their magnificence, of any weaknesss.

But we, while wholly concentrating on one thing,
already feel the pressure of another.
Hatred is our first response. And lovers,
are they not forever invading one another's
boundaries? -although they promised space,
hunting and homeland. Then, for a sketch
drawn at a moment's impulse, a ground of contrast
is prepared, painfully, so that we may see.
For they are most exact with us. We do not know
the contours of our feelings. We only know 
what shapes them from the outside. 

Who has not sat, afraid, before his own heart's
curtain? It lifted and displayed the scenery
of departure. Easy to understand. The well-known
garden swaying just a little. Then came the dancer.
Not he! Enough! However lightly he pretends to move:
he is just disguised, costumed, an ordinary man
who enters through the kitchen when coming home.
I will not have these half-filled human masks;
better the puppet. It at least is full.
I will endure this well-stuffed doll, the wire,
the face that is nothing but appearance. Here out front
I wait. Even if the lights go down and I am told:
""There's nothing more to come,"" -even if
the grayish drafts of emptiness come drifting down
from the deserted stage -even if not one
of my now silent forebears sist beside me
any longer, not a woman, not even a boy-
he with the brown and squinting eyes-:
I'll still remain. For one can always watch.

Am I not right? You, to whom life would taste
so bitter, Father, after you - for my sake -
slipped of mine, that first muddy infusion
of my necessity. You kept on tasting, Father,
as I kept on growing, troubled by the aftertaste
of my so strange a future as you kept searching
my unfocused gaze -you who, so often since
you died, have been afraid for my well-being,
within my deepest hope, relinquishing that calmness,
the realms of equanimity such as the dead possess
for my so small fate -Am I not right?

And you, my parents, am I not right? You who loved me
for that small beginning of my love for you
from which I always shyly turned away, because
the distance in your features grew, changed,
even while I loved it, into cosmic space
where you no longer were...: and when I feel
inclined to wait before the puppet stage, no,
rather to stare at is so intensely that in the end
to counter-balance my searching gaze, an angel
has to come as an actor, and begin manipulating
the lifeless bodies of the puppets to perform.
Angel and puppet! Now at last there is a play!
Then what we seperate can come together by our
very presence. And only then the entire cycle
of our own life-seasons is revealed and set in motion.
Above, beyond us, the angel plays. Look:
must not the dying notice how unreal, how full
of pretense is all that we accomplish here, where
nothing is to be itself. O hours of childhood,
when behind each shape more that the past lay hidden,
when that which lay before us was not the future.

We grew, of course, and sometimes were impatient
in growing up, half for the sake of pleasing those
with nothing left but their own grown-upness.
Yet, when alone, we entertained ourselves
with what alone endures, we would stand there
in the infinite space that spans the world and toys,
upon a place, which from the first beginnniing
had been prepared to serve a pure event.

Who shows a child just as it stands? Who places him
within his constellation, with the measuring-rod
of distance in his hand. Who makes his death
from gray bread that grows hard, -or leaves
it there inside his rounded mouth, jagged as the core
of a sweet apple?.......The minds of murderers
are easily comprehended. But this: to contain death,
the whole of death, even before life has begun,
to hold it all so gently within oneself,
and not be angry: that is indescribable.",Elegy
21,Rainer Maria Rilke,From The Tenth Elegy,"Ah, but the City of Pain: how strange its streets are:
the false silence of sound drowning sound,
and there--proud, brazen, effluence from the mold of emptiness--
the gilded hubbub, the bursting monument.
How an Angel would stamp out their market of solaces,
set up alongside their church bought to order:
clean and closed and woeful as a post office on Sunday.
Outside, though, there's always the billowing edge of the fair.
Swings of Freedom! High-divers and Jugglers of Zeal!
And the shooting gallery with its figures of idiot Happiness
which jump, quiver, and fall with a tinny ring
whenever some better marksman scores. Onward he lurches from cheers
to chance; for booths courting each curious taste
are drumming and barking. And then--for adults only--
a special show: how money breeds, its anatomy, not some charade:
money's genitals, everything, the whole act
from beginning to end--educational and guaranteed to make you
virile . . . . . . . . .
. . . . Oh, but just beyond that,
behind the last of the billboards, plastered with signs for ""Deathless,""
that bitter beer which tastes sweet to those drinking it
as long as they have fresh distractions to chew . . . ,
just beyond those boards, just on the other side: things are real.
Children play, lovers hold each other, off in the shadows,
pensive, on the meager grass, while dogs obey nature.
The youth is drawn farther on; perhaps he's fallen in love
with a young Lament . . . . . He pursues her, enters meadowland.
She says:
""It's a long way. We live out there . . .""
                                             Where? And the youth follows.
Something in her bearing stirs him. Her shoulders, neck--,
perhaps she's of noble descent. Still, he leaves her, turns around,
glances back, waves . . . What's the use? She's a Lament.


Translated by Edward Snow",Elegy
22,John Donne,Elegy Xiii: His Parting From Her,"SINCE she must go, and I must mourn, come night, 
Environ me with darkness, whilst I write ; 
Shadow that hell unto me, which alone 
I am to suffer when my love is gone. 
Alas ! the darkest magic cannot do it, 
Thou and great hell, to boot, are shadows to it. 
Should Cynthia quit thee, Venus, and each star, 
It would not form one thought dark as mine are. 
I could lend them obscureness now, and say
Out of my self, there should be no more day. 
Such is already my self-want of sight, 
Did not the fire within me force a light. 
O Love, that fire and darkness should be mix'd, 
Or to thy triumphs such strange torments fix'd ! 
Is it because thou thyself art blind, that we, 
Thy martyrs, must no more each other see ? 
Or takest thou pride to break us on the wheel, 
And view old Chaos in the pains we feel ? 
Or have we left undone some mutual rite, 
That thus with parting thou seek'st us to spite ? 
No, no. The fault is mine, impute it to me, 
Or rather to conspiring destiny, 
Which, since I loved in jest before, decreed
That I should suffer, when I loved indeed ; 
And therefore, sooner now than I can say, 
I saw the golden fruit, 'tis rapt away ; 
Or as I'd watch'd one drop in the vast stream, 
And I left wealthy only in a dream. 
Yet, Love, thou'rt blinder than myself in this, 
To vex my dove-like friend for my amiss ; 
And where one sad truth may expiate 
Thy wrath, to make her fortune run my fate. 
So blinded justice doth, when favourites fall, 
Strike them, their house, their friends, their favourites all. 
Was't not enough that thou didst dart thy fires 
Into our bloods, inflaming our desires, 
And madest us sigh, and blow, and pant, and burn, 
And then thyself into our flames didst turn ? 
Was't not enough that thou didst hazard us 
To paths in love so dark and dangerous, 
And those so ambush'd round with household spies, 
And over all thy husband's towering eyes, 
Inflamed with th' ugly sweat of jealousy ; 
Yet went we not still on in constancy ? 
Have we for this kept guards, like spy on spy ? 
Had correspondence whilst the foe stood by ? 
Stolen, more to sweeten them, our many blisses 
Of meetings, conference, embracements, kisses ? 
Shadow'd with negligence our best respects ? 
Varied our language through all dialects 
Of becks, winks, looks, and often under boards 
Spoke dialogues with our feet far from our words ? 
Have we proved all the secrets of our art, 
Yea, thy pale inwards, and thy panting heart ? 
And, after all this passed purgatory, 
Must sad divorce make us the vulgar story ? 
First let our eyes be riveted quite through 
Our turning brain, and both our lips grow to ; 
Let our arms clasp like ivy, and our fear 
Freeze us together, that we may stick here, 
Till Fortune, that would ruin us with the deed, 
Strain his eyes open, and yet make them bleed. 
For Love it cannot be, whom hitherto 
I have accused, should such a mischief do. 
O Fortune, thou'rt not worth my least exclaim, 
And plague enough thou hast in thy own name. 
Do thy great worst ; my friend and I have charms, 
Though not against thy strokes, against thy harms. 
Rend us in sunder ; thou canst not divide 
Our bodies so, but that our souls are tied, 
And we can love by letters still and gifts, 
And thoughts and dreams ; love never wanteth shifts. 
I will not look upon the quickening sun, 
But straight her beauty to my sense shall run ; 
The air shall note her soft, the fire, most pure ; 
Waters suggest her clear, and the earth sure. 
Time shall not lose our passages ; the spring, 
How fresh our love was in the beginning ; 
The summer, how it ripen'd in the year ; 
And autumn, what our golden harvests were ; 
The winter I'll not think on to spite thee, 
But count it a lost season ; so shall she. 
And dearest friend, since we must part, drown night 
With hope of day—burdens well borne are light— ; 
The cold and darkness longer hang somewhere, 
Yet Phoebus equally lights all the sphere ; 
And what we cannot in like portion pay 
The world enjoys in mass, and so we may. 
Be then ever yourself, and let no woe 
Win on your health, your youth, your beauty ; so 
Declare yourself base Fortune's enemy, 
No less be your contempt than her inconstancy ; 
That I may grow enamour'd on your mind, 
When mine own thoughts I here neglected find. 
And this to the comfort of my dear I vow, 
My deeds shall still be what my deeds are now ; 
The poles shall move to teach me ere I start ; 
And when I change my love, I'll change my heart. 
Nay, if I wax but cold in my desire, 
Think, heaven hath motion lost, and the world, fire. 
Much more I could, but many words have made 
That oft suspected which men most persuade. 
Take therefore all in this ; I love so true, 
As I will never look for less in you.",Elegy
23,Carolyn Forché,Elegy,"The page opens to snow on a field: boot-holed month, black hour
the bottle in your coat half voda half winter light.
To what and to whom does one say yes?
If God were the uncertain, would you cling to him?

Beneath a tattoo of stars the gate open, so silent so like a tomb.
This is the city you most loved, an empty stairwell
where the next rain lifts invisibly from the Seine.

With solitude, your coat open, you walk
steadily as if the railings were there and your hands weren't passing 
        through them.

""When things were ready, they poured on fuel and touched off the fire.
They waited for a high wind. It was very fine, that powdered bone.
It was put into sacks, and when there was enough we went to a bridge 
        on the Narew River.""

And even less explicit phrases survived:
""To make charcoal.
For laundry irons.""
And so we revolt against silence with a bit of speaking.
The page is a charred field where the dead would have written
We went on. And it was like living through something again one 
        could not live through again.

The soul behind you no longer inhabits your life: the unlit house
with its breathless windows and a chimney of ruined wings
where wind becomes an aria, your name, voices from a field,
And you, smoke, dissonance, a psalm, a stairwell.


Anonymous submission.",Elegy
24,Anna Akhmatova,March Elegy,"I have enough treasures from the past
to last me longer than I need, or want.
You know as well as I . . . malevolent memory
won't let go of half of them:
a modest church, with its gold cupola
slightly askew; a harsh chorus
of crows; the whistle of a train;
a birch tree haggard in a field
as if it had just been sprung from jail;
a secret midnight conclave
of monumental Bible-oaks;
and a tiny rowboat that comes drifting out
of somebody's dreams, slowly foundering.
Winter has already loitered here,
lightly powdering these fields,
casting an impenetrable haze
that fills the world as far as the horizon.
I used to think that after we are gone
there's nothing, simply nothing at all.
Then who's that wandering by the porch
again and calling us by name?
Whose face is pressed against the frosted pane?
What hand out there is waving like a branch?
By way of reply, in that cobwebbed corner
a sunstruck tatter dances in the mirror.",Elegy
25,John Donne,Elegy Viii: The Comparison,"As the sweet sweat of roses in a still,
As that which from chafed musk-cats' pores doth trill,
As the almighty balm of th' early East,
Such are the sweat drops of my mistress' breast,
And on her brow her skin such lustre sets,
They seem no sweat drops, but pearl coronets.
Rank sweaty froth thy Mistress's brow defiles,
Like spermatic issue of ripe menstruous boils,
Or like the scum, which, by need's lawless law
Enforced, Sanserra's starved men did draw
From parboiled shoes and boots, and all the rest
Which were with any sovereigne fatness blest,
And like vile lying stones in saffroned tin,
Or warts, or weals, they hang upon her skin.
Round as the world's her head, on every side,
Like to the fatal ball which fell on Ide,

Or that whereof God had such jealousy,
As, for the ravishing thereof we die.
Thy head is like a rough-hewn statue of jet,
Where marks for eyes, nose, mouth, are yet scarce set;
Like the first Chaos, or flat-seeming face
Of Cynthia, when th' earth's shadows her embrace.
Like Proserpine's white beauty-keeping chest,
Or Jove's best fortunes urn, is her fair breast.
Thine's like worm-eaten trunks, clothed in seals' skin,
Or grave, that's dust without, and stink within.
And like that slender stalk, at whose end stands
The woodbine quivering, are her arms and hands.
Like rough barked elm-boughs, or the russet skin
Of men late scourged for madness, or for sin,
Like sun-parched quarters on the city gate,
Such is thy tanned skin's lamentable state.
And like a bunch of ragged carrots stand
The short swol'n fingers of thy gouty hand.
Then like the Chimic's masculine equal fire,
Which in the Lymbecks warm womb doth inspire
Into th' earth's worthless dirt a soul of gold,
Such cherishing heat her best loved part doth hold.
Thine's like the dread mouth of a fired gun,
Or like hot liquid metals newly run
Into clay moulds, or like to that Etna
Where round about the grass is burnt away.
Are not your kisses then as filthy, and more,
As a worm sucking an envenomed sore?
Doth not thy feareful hand in feeling quake,
As one which gath'ring flowers still fears a snake?
Is not your last act harsh, and violent,
As when a plough a stony ground doth rent?
So kiss good turtles, so devoutly nice
Are priests in handling reverent sacrifice,
And such in searching wounds the surgeon is
As we, when we embrace, or touch, or kiss.
Leave her, and I will leave comparing thus,
She, and comparisons are odious.",Elegy
26,John Donne,Elegy V: His Picture,"Here take my picture; though I bid farewell
Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell.
'Tis like me now, but I dead, 'twill be more
When we are shadows both, than 'twas before.
When weather-beaten I come back, my hand
Perhaps with rude oars torn, or sun beams tann'd,
My face and breast of haircloth, and my head
With care's rash sudden storms being o'erspread,
My body'a sack of bones, broken within,
And powder's blue stains scatter'd on my skin;
If rival fools tax thee to'have lov'd a man
So foul and coarse as, oh, I may seem then,
This shall say what I was, and thou shalt say,
'Do his hurts reach me? doth my worth decay?
Or do they reach his judging mind, that he
Should now love less, what he did love to see?
That which in him was fair and delicate,
Was but the milk which in love's childish state
Did nurse it; who now is grown strong enough
To feed on that, which to disus'd tastes seems tough.'",Elegy
27,Ovid,Elegy V,"In summer's heat and mid-time of the day
To rest my limbs upon a bed I lay,
One window shut, the other open stood,
Which gave such light, as twinkles in a wood,
Like twilight glimpse at setting of the sun,
Or night being past, and yet not day begun.
Such light to shamefast maidens must be shown,
Where they must sport, and seem to be unknown.
Then came Corinna in a long loose gown,
Her white neck hid with tresses hanging down:
Resembling fair Semiramis going to bed
Or Layis of a thousand wooers sped.
I snatched her gown, being thin, the harm was small,
Yet strived she to be covered there withal.
And striving thus as one that would be chaste,
Betrayed herself, and yeilded at the last.
Stark naked as she stood before mine eye,
Not one wen in her body could I spy.
What arms and shoulders did I touch and see,
How apt her breasts were to be pressed by me.
How smooth a belly under her waist saw I?
How large a leg, and what a lusty thigh?
To leave the rest, all liked me passing well,
I clinged her naked body, down she fell,
Judge you the rest, being tired she bade me kiss,
Jove sent me more such afternoons as this.",Elegy
28,Gilbert Keith Chesterton,Elegy In A Country Churchyard,"The men that worked for England 
They have their graves at home: 
And bees and birds of England 
About the cross can roam. 

But they that fought for England, 
Following a falling star, 
Alas, alas for England 
They have their graves afar. 

And they that rule in England, 
In stately conclave met, 
Alas, alas for England, 
They have no graves as yet.",Elegy
29,John Donne,Elegy Iv: The Perfume,"Once, and but once found in thy company,
All thy supposed escapes are laid on me;
And as a thief at bar is questioned there
By all the men that have been robed that year,
So am I (by this traiterous means surprized)
By thy hydroptic father catechized.
Though he had wont to search with glazed eyes,
As though he came to kill a cockatrice,
Though he hath oft sworn that he would remove
Thy beauty's beauty, and food of our love,
Hope of his goods, if I with thee were seen,
Yet close and secret, as our souls, we've been.
Though thy immortal mother, which doth lie
Still-buried in her bed, yet wiil not die,
Takes this advantage to sleep out daylight,
And watch thy entries and returns all night,
And, when she takes thy hand, and would seem kind,
Doth search what rings and armlets she can find,
And kissing, notes the colour of thy face,
And fearing lest thou'rt swol'n, doth thee embrace;
To try if thou long, doth name strange meats,
And notes thy paleness, blushing, sighs, and sweats;
And politicly will to thee confess
The sins of her own youth's rank lustiness;
Yet love these sorceries did remove, and move
Thee to gull thine own mother for my love.
Thy little brethren, which like faery sprites
Oft skipped into our chamber, those sweet nights,
And kissed, and ingled on thy father's knee,
Were bribed next day to tell what they did see:
The grim eight-foot-high iron-bound servingman,
That oft names God in oaths, and only then,
He that to bar the first gate doth as wide
As the great Rhodian Colossus stride,
Which, if in hell no other pains there were,
Makes me fear hell, because he must be there:
Though by thy father he were hired to this,
Could never witness any touch or kiss.
But Oh, too common ill, I brought with me
That which betrayed me to my enemy:
A loud perfume, which at my entrance cried
Even at thy father's nose, so were we spied;
When, like a tyran King, that in his bed
Smelt gunpowder, the pale wretch shivered.
Had it been some bad smell he would have thought
That his own feet, or breath, that smell had wrought.
But as we in our isle imprisoned,
Where cattle only, and diverse dogs are bred,
The precious Unicorns strange monsters call,
So thought he good, strange, that had none at all.
I taught my silks their whistling to forbear,
Even my oppressed shoes dumb and speechless were,
Only, thou bitter sweet, whom I had laid
Next me, me traiterously hast betrayed,
And unsuspected hast invisibly
At once fled unto him, and stayed with me.
Base excrement of earth, which dost confound
Sense from distinguishing the sick from sound;
By thee the seely amorous sucks his death
By drawing in a leprous harlot's breath;
By thee the greatest stain to man's estate
Falls on us, to be called effeminate;
Though you be much loved in the Prince's hall,
There, things that seem, exceed substantial.
Gods, when ye fumed on altars, were pleased well,
Because you were burnt, not that they liked your smell;
You're loathsome all, being taken simply alone,
Shall we love ill things joined, and hate each one?
If you were good, your good doth soon decay;
And you are rare, that takes the good away.
All my perfumes I give most willingly
T' embalm thy father's corse; What? will he die?",Elegy
30,John Donne,Elegy Ix: The Autumnal,"No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace
    As I have seen in one autumnal face.
Young beauties force our love, and that's a rape,
    This doth but counsel, yet you cannot scape.
If 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame;
    Affection here takes reverence's name.
Were her first years the golden age? That's true,
    But now she's gold oft tried and ever new.
That was her torrid and inflaming time,
    This is her tolerable tropic clime.
Fair eyes, who asks more heat than comes from hence,
    He in a fever wishes pestilence.
Call not these wrinkles, graves; if graves they were,
    They were Love's graves, for else he is no where.
Yet lies not Love dead here, but here doth sit
    Vow'd to this trench, like an anachorit;
And here till hers, which must be his death, come,
    He doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb.
Here dwells he; though he sojourn ev'rywhere
    In progress, yet his standing house is here:
Here where still evening is, not noon nor night,
    Where no voluptuousness, yet all delight.
In all her words, unto all hearers fit,
    You may at revels, you at council, sit.
This is Love's timber, youth his underwood;
    There he, as wine in June, enrages blood,
Which then comes seasonabliest when our taste
    And appetite to other things is past.
Xerxes' strange Lydian love, the platan tree,
    Was lov'd for age, none being so large as she,
Or else because, being young, nature did bless
    Her youth with age's glory, barrenness.
If we love things long sought, age is a thing
    Which we are fifty years in compassing;
If transitory things, which soon decay,
    Age must be loveliest at the latest day.
But name not winter faces, whose skin's slack,
    Lank as an unthrift's purse, but a soul's sack;
Whose eyes seek light within, for all here's shade;
    Whose mouths are holes, rather worn out than made;
Whose every tooth to a several place is gone,
    To vex their souls at resurrection:
Name not these living death's-heads unto me,
    For these, not ancient, but antique be.
I hate extremes, yet I had rather stay
    With tombs than cradles, to wear out a day.
Since such love's natural lation is, may still
    My love descend, and journey down the hill,
Not panting after growing beauties. So,
    I shall ebb on with them who homeward go.",Elegy
31,John Donne,Elegy Ii: The Anagram,"Marry, and love thy Flavia, for she
Hath all things whereby others beautious be,
For, though her eyes be small, her mouth is great,
Though they be ivory, yet her teeth be jet,
Though they be dim, yet she is light enough,
And though her harsh hair fall, her skin is rough;
What though her cheeks be yellow, her hair's red;
Give her thine, and she hath a maidenhead.
These things are beauty's elements, where these
Meet in one, that one must, as perfect, please.
If red and white and each good quality
Be in thy wench, ne'er ask where it doth lie.
In buying things perfumed, we ask if there
Be musk and amber in it, but not where.
Though all her parts be not in th' usual place,
She hath yet an anagram of a good face.
If we might put the letters but one way,
In the lean dearth of words, what could we say?
When by the Gamut some Musicians make
A perfect song, others will undertake,
By the same Gamut changed, to equal it.
Things simply good can never be unfit.
She's fair as any, if all be like her,
And if none be, then she is singular.
All love is wonder; if we justly do
Account her wonderful, why not lovely too?
Love built on beauty, soon as beauty, dies;
Choose this face, changed by no deformities.
Women are all like angels; the fair be
Like those which fell to worse; but such as thee,
Like to good angels, nothing can impair:
'Tis less grief to be foul than t' have been fair.
For one night's revels, silk and gold we choose,
But, in long journeys, cloth and leather use.
Beauty is barren oft; best husbands say,
There is best land where there is foulest way.
Oh what a sovereign plaster will she be,
If thy past sins have taught thee jealousy!
Here needs no spies, nor eunuchs; her commit
Safe to thy foes; yea, to a Marmosit.
When Belgia's cities the round countries drown,
That dirty foulness guards, and arms the town:
So doth her face guard her; and so, for thee,
Which, forced by business, absent oft must be,
She, whose face, like clouds, turns the day to night;
Who, mightier than the sea, makes Moors seem white;
Who, though seven years she in the stews had laid,
A Nunnery durst receive, and think a maid;
And though in childbed's labour she did lie,
Midwives would swear 'twere but a tympany;
Whom, if she accuse herself, I credit less
Than witches, which impossibles confess;
Whom dildoes, bedstaves, and her velvet glass
Would be as loath to touch as Joseph was:
One like none, and liked of none, fittest were,
For, things in fashion every man will wear.",Elegy
32,John Donne,Elegy Vii,"Nature's lay idiot, I taught thee to love,
And in that sophistry, Oh, thou dost prove
Too subtle: Foole, thou didst not understand
The mystic language of the eye nor hand:
Nor couldst thou judge the difference of the air
Of sighs, and say, This lies, this sounds despair:
Nor by th' eyes water call a malady
Desperately hot, or changing feverously.
I had not taught thee, then, the Alphabet
Of flowers, how they devisefully being set
And bound up might with speechless secrecy
Deliver errands mutely, and mutually.
Remember since all thy words used to be
To every suitor, Ay, if my friends agree;
Since, household charms, thy husband's name to teach,
Were all the love tricks that thy wit could reach;
And since, an hour's discourse could scarce have made
One answer in thee, and that ill arrayed
In broken proverbs and torn sentences.
Thou art not by so many duties his,
That from the world's Common having severed thee,
Inlaid thee, neither to be seen, nor see,
As mine: who have with amorous delicacies
Refined thee into a blisful Paradise.
Thy graces and good words my creatures be;
I planted knowledge and life's tree in thee,
Which Oh, shall strangers taste? Must I alas
Frame and enamel plate, and drink in glass?
Chaf wax for others' seals? break a colt's force
And leave him then, being made a ready horse?",Elegy
33,Edna St. Vincent Millay,Elegy Before Death,"There will be rose and rhododendron
When you are dead and under ground;
Still will be heard from white syringas
Heavy with bees, a sunny sound;

Still will the tamaracks be raining
After the rain has ceased, and still
Will there be robins in the stubble,
Brown sheep upon the warm green hill.

Spring will not ail nor autumn falter;
Nothing will know that you are gone,
Saving alone some sullen plough-land
None but yourself sets foot upon;

Saving the may-weed and the pig-weed
Nothing will know that you are dead,—
These, and perhaps a useless wagon
Standing beside some tumbled shed.

Oh, there will pass with your great passing
Little of beauty not your own,—
Only the light from common water,
Only the grace from simple stone!",Elegy
34,John Donne,Elegy Iii: Change,"Although thy hand and faith, and good works too,
Have seal'd thy love which nothing should undo,
Yea though thou fall back, that apostasy
Confirm thy love; yet much, much I fear thee.
Women are like the Arts, forc'd unto none,
Open to'all searchers, unpriz'd, if unknown.
If I have caught a bird, and let him fly,
Another fouler using these means, as I,
May catch the same bird; and, as these things be,
Women are made for men, not him, nor me.
Foxes and goats; all beasts change when they please,
Shall women, more hot, wily, wild then these,
Be bound to one man, and did Nature then
Idly make them apter to endure than men?
They are our clogges, not their owne; if a man be
Chain'd to a galley, yet the galley is free;
Who hath a plow-land, casts all his seed corn there,
And yet allows his ground more corn should bear;
Though Danuby into the sea must flow,
The sea receives the Rhene, Volga, and Po.
By nature, which gave it, this liberty
Thou lov'st, but Oh! canst thou love it and me?
Likeness glues love: Then if so thou do,
To make us like and love, must I change too?
More than thy hate, I hate it, rather let me
Allow her change, then change as oft as she,
And so not teach, but force my opinion
To love not any one, nor every one.
To live in one land is captivity,
To run all countries, a wild roguery;
Waters stink soon, if in one place they bide,
And in the vast sea are worse putrified:
But when they kiss one bank, and leaving this
Never look back, but the next bank do kiss,
Then are they purest; Change is the nursery
Of music, joy, life, and eternity.",Elegy
35,Edna St. Vincent Millay,Elegy,"Let them bury your big eyes
In the secret earth securely,
Your thin fingers, and your fair,
Soft, indefinite-colored hair,—
All of these in some way, surely,
From the secret earth shall rise;
Not for these I sit and stare,
Broken and bereft completely;
Your young flesh that sat so neatly
On your little bones will sweetly
Blossom in the air.

But your voice,—never the rushing
Of a river underground,
Not the rising of the wind
In the trees before the rain,
Not the woodcock's watery call,
Not the note the white-throat utters,
Not the feet of children pushing
Yellow leaves along the gutters
In the blue and bitter fall,
Shall content my musing mind
For the beauty of that sound
That in no new way at all
Ever will be heard again.

Sweetly through the sappy stalk
Of the vigorous weed,
Holding all it held before,
Cherished by the faithful sun,
On and on eternally
Shall your altered fluid run,
Bud and bloom and go to seed;
But your singing days are done;
But the music of your talk
Never shall the chemistry
Of the secret earth restore.
All your lovely words are spoken.
Once the ivory box is broken,
Beats the golden bird no more.",Elegy

The last day of March, 1727:
To the great joy of Bryan
That his antagonist is gone.

And is poor Tiger laid at last so low?
O day of sorrow! -Day of dismal woe!
Bloodhounds, or spaniels, lap-dogs, 'tis all one,
When Death once whistles -snap! -away they're gone.
See how she lies, and hangs her lifeless ears,
Bathed in her mournful lady's tears!
Dumb is her throat, and wagless is her tail,
Doomed to the grave, to Death's eternal jail!
In a few days this lovely creature must
First turn to clay, and then be changed to dust.
That mouth which used its lady's mouth to lick
Must yield its jaw-bones to the worms to pick.
That mouth which used the partridge-wing to eat
Must give its palate to the worms to eat.

Methinks I see her now in Charon's boat
Bark at the Stygian fish which round it float;
While Cerberus, alarmed to hear the sound,
Makes Hell's wide concave bellow all around.
She sees him not, but hears him through the dark,
And valiantly returns him bark for bark.
But now she trembles -though a ghost, she dreads
To see a dog with three large yawning heads.
Spare her, you hell-hounds, case your frightful paws,
And let poor Tiger 'scape your furious jaws.
Let her go safe to the Elysian plains,
Where Hylax barks among the Mantuan swains;
There let her frisk about her new-found love:
She loved a dog when she was here above.

The Epitaph

Here lies beneath this marble
An animal could bark, or warble:
Sometimes a bitch, sometimes a bird,

37,Lorraine Margueritte Gasrel  ..,Elegy To Time,"Like rainbows dissolving or love's end
We mourn the parting of friends

As the Sun travels East to West
Do we wonder where or when it will rest

In the Spring a world reborn
A child's first step this Summer's morn

Autumn's passing into Winter's night
Shows a glimmer of Heaven's light

And slowly ticks the clock and chimes
As in passing beats our time.",Elegy
38,John Gay,An Elegy On A Lap-Dog,"1     Shock's fate I mourn; poor Shock is now no more,
2     Ye Muses mourn, ye chamber-maids deplore.
3     Unhappy Shock! yet more unhappy fair,
4     Doom'd to survive thy joy and only care!
5     Thy wretched fingers now no more shall deck,
6     And tie the fav'rite ribbon round his neck;
7     No more thy hand shall smooth his glossy hair,
8     And comb the wavings of his pendent ear.
9     Yet cease thy flowing grief, forsaken maid;
10   All mortal pleasures in a moment fade:
11   Our surest hope is in an hour destroy'd,
12   And love, best gift of heav'n, not long enjoy'd.

13         Methinks I see her frantic with despair,
14   Her streaming eyes, wrung hands, and flowing hair
15   Her Mechlen pinners rent the floor bestrow,
16   And her torn fan gives real signs of woe.
17   Hence Superstition, that tormenting guest,
18   That haunts with fancied fears the coward breast;
19   No dread events upon his fate attend,
20   Stream eyes no more, no more thy tresses rend.
21   Tho' certain omens oft forewarn a state,
22   And dying lions show the monarch's fate;
23   Why should such fears bid Celia's sorrow rise?
24   For when a lap-dog falls no lover dies.

25         Cease, Celia, cease; restrain thy flowing tears,
26   Some warmer passion will dispel thy cares.
27   In man you'll find a more substantial bliss,
28   More grateful toying, and a sweeter kiss.

29         He's dead. Oh lay him gently in the ground!
30   And may his tomb be by this verse renown'd.
31   Here Shock, the pride of all his kind, is laid;
32   Who fawn'd like man, but ne'er like man betray'd.",Elegy
39,Siegfried Sassoon,Elegy,"Your dextrous wit will haunt us long 
Wounding our grief with yesterday. 
Your laughter is a broken song; 
And death has found you, kind and gay. 

We may forget those transient things
That made your charm and our delight: 
But loyal love has deathless wings 
That rise and triumph out of night. 

So, in the days to come, your name 
Shall be as music that ascends 
When honour turns a heart from shame... 
O heart of hearts! ... O friend of friends!",Elegy
40,John Donne,Elegy Vi,"Oh, let me not serve so, as those men serve
Whom honour's smokes at once fatten and starve;
Poorly enrich't with great men's words or looks;
Nor so write my name in thy loving books
As those idolatrous flatterers, which still
Their Prince's styles, with many realms fulfil
Whence they no tribute have, and where no sway.
Such services I offer as shall pay
Themselves, I hate dead names: Oh then let me
Favourite in Ordinary, or no favourite be.
When my soul was in her own body sheathed,
Nor yet by oaths betrothed, nor kisses breathed
Into my Purgatory, faithless thee,
Thy heart seemed wax, and steel thy constancy:
So, careless flowers strowed on the waters face
The curled whirlpools suck, smack, and embrace,
Yet drown them; so, the taper's beamy eye
Amorously twinkling beckons the giddy fly,
Yet burns his wings; and such the devil is,
Scarce visiting them who are entirely his.
When I behold a stream which, from the spring,
Doth with doubtful melodious murmuring,
Or in a speechless slumber, calmly ride
Her wedded channels' bosom, and then chide
And bend her brows, and swell if any bough
Do but stoop down, or kiss her upmost brow:
Yet, if her often gnawing kisses win
The traiterous bank to gape, and let her in,
She rusheth violently, and doth divorce
Her from her native, and her long-kept course,
And roars, and braves it, and in gallant scorn,
In flattering eddies promising retorn,
She flouts the channel, who thenceforth is dry;
Then say I, That is she, and this am I.
Yet let not thy deep bitterness beget
Careless despair in me, for that will whet
My mind to scorn; and Oh, love dulled with pain
Was ne'er so wise, nor well armed as disdain.
Then with new eyes I shall survey thee, and spy
Death in thy cheeks, and darkness in thine eye.
Though hope bred faith and love: thus taught, I shall,
As nations do from Rome, from thy love fall.
My hate shall outgrow thine, and utterly
I will renounce thy dalliance: and when I
Am the recusant, in that resolute state,
What hurts it me to be excommunicate?",Elegy
41,Sandra Fowler,An Elegy In Frost,"Cold sunshine writes our elegy in frost, 
Author of light a million snowflakes lost, 
All gone forever into swirling air, 
A dance of death that is no longer there.

Pure poetry becomes a stanza said, 
Classical white a message left unread, 
While we stand longing for a winter past, 
Hurt by a mood that was too fey to last.

Your hand in mine for eloquence atones.

43,John Donne,Elegy Xvi: The Expostulation,"TO make the doubt clear, that no woman's true,
Was it my fate to prove it strong in you?
Thought I, but one had breathèd purest air ;
And must she needs be false, because she's fair?
Is it your beauty's mark, or of your youth,
Or your perfection, not to study truth?
Or think you heaven is deaf, or hath no eyes?
Or those it hath smile at your perjuries?
Are vows so cheap with women, or the matter
Whereof they're made, that they are writ in water,
And blown away with wind?   Or doth their breath
Both hot and cold, at once make life and death?
Who could have thought so many accents sweet
Form'd into words, so may sighs should meet
As from our hearts, so many oaths, and tears
Sprinkled among, all sweeten'd by our fears,
And the divine impression of stolen kisses,
That seal'd the rest, should now prove empty blisses?
Did you draw bonds to forfeit? sign to break?
Or must we read you quite from what you speak,
And find the truth out the wrong way? or must
He first desire you false, would wish you just?
O ! I profane ! though most of women be
This kind of beast, my thoughts shall except thee,
My dearest love ; though froward jealousy
With circumstance might urge thy inconstancy,
Sooner I'll think the sun will cease to cheer
The teeming earth, and that forget to bear ;
Sooner that rivers will run back, or Thames
With ribs of ice in June will bind his streams ;
Or nature, by whose strength the world endures,
Would change her course, before you alter yours.
But O ! that treacherous breast, to whom weak you
Did drift our counsels, and we both may rue,
Having his falsehood found too late ; 'twas he
That made me cast you guilty, and you me ;
Whilst he, black wretch, betray'd each simple word
We spake, unto the cunning of a third.
Cursed may he be, that so our love hath slain,
And wander on the earth, wretched as Cain,
Wretched as he, and not deserve least pity.
In plaguing him, let misery be witty ;
Let all eyes shun him, and he shun each eye,
Till he be noisome as his infamy ;
May he without remorse deny God thrice,
And not be trusted more on his soul's price ;
And, after all self-torment, when he dies,
May wolves tear out his heart, vultures his eyes,
Swine eat his bowels, and his falser tongue
That utter'd all, be to some raven flung ;
And let his carrion corse be a longer feast
To the king's dogs, than any other beast.
Now have I cursed, let us our love revive ;
In me the flame was never more alive.
I could begin again to court and praise,
And in that pleasure lengthen the short days
Of my life's lease ; like painters that do take
Delight, not in made work, but whiles they make.
I could renew those times, when first I saw
Love in your eyes, that gave my tongue the law
To like what you liked ; and at masks and plays
Commend the self-same actors, the same ways ;
Ask how you did, and often with intent
Of being officious, be impertinent ;
All which were such soft pastimes, as in these
Love was as subtly catch'd as a disease.
But being got, it is a treasure sweet,
Which to defend is harder than to get ;
And ought not be profaned, on either part,
For though 'tis got by chance, 'tis kept by art.",Elegy
44,Joseph Brodsky,Elegy,"About a year has passed. I've returned to the place of the battle,
to its birds that have learned their unfolding of wings 
from a subtle
lift of a surprised eyebrow, or perhaps from a razor blade
- wings, now the shade of early twilight, now of state 
bad blood.

Now the place is abuzz with trading
in your ankles's remnants, bronzes
of sunburnt breastplates, dying laughter, bruises,
rumors of fresh reserves, memories of high treason,
laundered banners with imprints of the many
    who since have risen.

All's overgrown with people. A ruin's a rather stubborn
architectural style. And the hearts's distinction
from a pitch-black cavern
isn't that great; not great enough to fear
that we may collide again like blind eggs somewhere.

At sunrise, when nobody stares at one's face, I often,
set out on foot to a monument cast in molten
lengthy bad dreams. And it says on the plinth ""commander

45,Ovid,Elegy For Tibullus,"If Memnon's mother mourned, Achilles's mother mourned, 
   and our sad fates can touch great goddesses, 
then weep, and loose your hair in grief you never earned, 
   Elegy, now ah! too much like your name.
That bard whose work was yours, who gave you fame, Tibullus, 
   burns on the mounded pyre, a lifeless corpse.
See Venus's boy, bearing his quiver upside down; 
   his bow is broken and his torch is quenched; 
look how he goes dejected:  his wings trail on the ground; 
   he smites his naked breast with violent hand; 
his tears dampen the curls that fall around his neck, 
   and heaving sobs keep breaking on his lips.
(Just so he went out, fair Iulus, from your house, 
   they say, at his brother Aeneas's funeral.) 
No less was Venus stunned by her Tibullus's death
   than when the fierce boar smote her lover's thigh.
They say we bards are sacred, favorites of the gods, 
   and even that there's something holy in us, 
but that churl Death defiles every sacred thing: 
   his shadowy hand appropriates us all.
Was Orpheus saved by his father and mother, who were gods, 
   or by his songs that tamed the astonished beasts? 
They say that that same father sang 'Linos!  Ai, Linos! '
   deep in the woods on his reluctant lyre.
And Homer, too, from whom, as from an endless fount, 
   bards' lips are moistened with the Muses' waters, 
one last day pulled him under Avernus's murky wave: 
   his songs alone escaped the greedy pyre.
The work of bards endures:  Troy's famous sufferings, 
   and the endless shroud, undone by nightly fraud.
So Nemesis and Delia:  both their names will live, 
   the one his first, the one his latest love.
But what use now your rites?  What use the Egyptian rattle? 
   What use, to have slept alone in an empty bed? 
When harsh fate steals away the good (forgive my words!) 
   I almost want to believe there are no gods.
Live virtuous:  you will die.  Respect the gods:  grim Death
   will drag you from their altars to your grave.
Write glorious verse, and see!  here Tibullus lies: 
   one small urn holds the dust of what he was.
Is it you the blazing pyre bears off, O sacred bard, 
   not dreading to be fed upon your breast? 
Flames that dare so great a blasphemy would burn
   the golden temples of the blessed gods! 
She turned aside her gaze who rules Mt. Eryx's heights, 
   and some say she could not restrain her tears.
And yet it's better thus than if Phaeacia's land
   had strewn mere dirt on your neglected grave.
Here, as you fled life, your mother closed your streaming
   eyes, and brought her last gifts to your ashes.
Here your sister joined your mother in her grief
   and came with loosened hair all disarrayed.
And with their kisses Nemesis and your first love
   joined theirs, and did not leave your pyre forsaken, 
and Delia, as she left, said, 'Happier far your love
   for me:  you lived, while I was still your flame.'
'Why, ' Nemesis replied, 'do you grieve for my loss? 
   Dying, he clutched me with his failing hand.'
If anything remains of us but name and shade, 
   Elysium's vale will be Tibullus's home, 
and you will greet him, learned Catullus, ivy bound
   on your young brow, with Calvus at your side, 
and you (if it is false that you betrayed your friend) 
   Gallus, careless of your blood and soul.
These shades will be your comrades, if any shades there are: 
   you have joined the blessed, elegant Tibullus.
May your bones find repose within their sheltering urn, 
   and may earth not lie heavy on your ashes.

46,James Thomson,"An Elegy Upon James Therburn, In Chatto","Now, Chatto, you're a dreary place,
Pale sorrow broods on ilka face;
Therburn has run his race.
And now, and now, ah me, alas!
The carl lies dead.

Having his paternoster said,
He took a dram and went to bed;
He fell asleep, and death was glad
That he had catched him; 
For Therburn was e'en ill bested,
That none did watch him.

For had the carl but been aware,
That meagre death, who none does spare,
T'attempt sic things should ever dare,
As stop his pipe;
He might have come to flee or scare;
The greedy gripe.

How he'd had but a gill or twae,
Death would nae got the victory sae,
Nor put poor Therburn o'er the brae,
Into the grave;

The fumbling fellow, some folks say, 
Should be jobbed on baith night and day;

Barren for ever and for aye,
Do what he will. 

Therefore they say he got some help
In getting of the little whelp;
But passing that, it makes me yelp,
But what remead?
Death lent him sic a cursed skelp,
That now he's dead.

And rest thy carcase soft and well,

48,John Donne,Elegy Xvii: On His Mistress,"By our first strange and fatal interview,
By all desires which thereof did ensue,
By our long starving hopes, by that remorse
Which my words masculine persuasive force
Begot in thee, and by the memory
Of hurts, which spies and rivals threaten'd me,
I calmly beg. But by thy father's wrath,
By all pains, which want and divorcement hath,
I conjure thee, and all the oaths which I
And thou have sworn to seal joint constancy,
Here I unswear, and overswear them thus ;
Thou shalt not love by ways so dangerous.
Temper, O fair love, love's impetuous rage ;
Be my true mistress still, not my feign'd page.
I'll go, and, by thy kind leave, leave behind
Thee, only worthy to nurse in my mind
Thirst to come back ; O ! if thou die before,
My soul from other lands to thee shall soar.
Thy else almighty beauty cannot move
Rage from the seas, nor thy love teach them love,
Nor tame wild Boreas' harshness ; thou hast read
How roughly he in pieces shivered
Fair Orithea, whom he swore he loved.
Fall ill or good, 'tis madness to have proved
Dangers unurged ; feed on this flattery,
That absent lovers one in th' other be.
Dissemble nothing, not a boy, nor change
Thy body's habit, nor mind ; be not strange
To thyself only. All will spy in thy face
A blushing womanly discovering grace.
Richly clothed apes are call'd apes, and as soon
Eclipsed as bright, we call the moon the moon.
Men of France, changeable chameleons,
Spitals of diseases, shops of fashions,
Love's fuellers, and the rightest company
Of players, which upon the world's stage be,
Will quickly know thee, and no less, alas !
Th' indifferent Italian, as we pass
His warm land, well content to think thee page,
Will hunt thee with such lust, and hideous rage,
As Lot's fair guests were vex'd. But none of these
Nor spongy hydroptic Dutch shall thee displease,
If thou stay here. O stay here, for for thee
England is only a worthy gallery,
To walk in expectation, till from thence
Our greatest king call thee to his presence.
When I am gone, dream me some happiness ;
Nor let thy looks our long-hid love confess ;
Nor praise, nor dispraise me, nor bless nor curse
Openly love's force, nor in bed fright thy nurse
With midnight's startings, crying out, O ! O !
Nurse, O ! my love is slain ; I saw him go
O'er the white Alps alone ; I saw him, I,
Assail'd, fight, taken, stabb'd, bleed, fall, and die.
Augur me better chance, except dread Jove

thousand pieces.
Why is it so far away?

Thinking of you, I go up on the hill and wander.
Around the hill, why is it such a sadness?

Dandelions yellow and shepherds-purse blooming white --
not anyone to look at them.

I hear a pheasant, calling and calling fervently.
Once a friend was there across the river, living.

Ghostly smoke rises and fades away with a west wind
strong in fields of small bamboo grasses and reedy fields.
Nowhere to leave for.

Once a friend was there across the river, living, but today
not even a bird sings a song.

You left in the morning, at evening my heart is in a
thousand pieces.
Why is it so far away?

In my grass hut by the Amida image I light no candle,
offer no flowers, and only sit here alone.
This evening, how invaluable it is.

50,Mark Akenside,Love: An Elegy,"Too much my heart of Beauty's power hath known,
Too long to Love hath reason left her throne;
Too long my genius mourn'd his myrtle chain,
And three rich years of youth consum'd in vain.
My wishes, lull'd with soft inglorious dreams,
Forgot the patriot's and the sage's themes:
Through each Elysian vale and fairy grove,
Through all the enchanted paradise of love,
Misled by sickly hope's deceitful flame,
Averse to action, and renouncing fame.

At last the visionary scenes decay,
My eyes, exulting, bless the new-born day,
Whose faithful beams detect the dangerous road
In which my heedless feet securely trod,
And strip the phantoms of their lying charms
That lur'd my soul from Wisdom's peaceful arms.

For silver streams and banks bespread with flowers,
For mossy couches and harmonious bowers,
Lo! barren heaths appear, and pathless woods,
And rocks hung dreadful o'er unfathom'd floods:
For openness of heart, for tender smiles,
Looks fraught with love, and wrath-disarming wiles;
Lo! sullen Spite, and perjur'd Lust of Gain,
And cruel Pride, and crueller Disdain;
Lo! cordial Faith to idiot airs refin'd,
Now coolly civil, now transporting kind.
For graceful Ease, lo! Affectation walks;
And dull Half-sense, for Wit and Wisdom talks.
New to each hour what low delight succeeds,
What precious furniture of hearts and heads!
By nought their prudence, but by getting, known,
And all their courage in deceiving shown.

See next what plagues attend the lover's state,
What frightful forms of Terror, Scorn, and Hate!
See burning Fury heaven and earth defy!
See Dumb Despair in icy fetters lie!
See black Suspicion bend his gloomy brow,
The hideous image of himself to view!
And fond Belief, with all a lover's flame,
Sink in those arms that point his head with shame!
There wan Dejection, faltering as he goes,
In shades and silence vainly seeks repose;
Musing through pathless wilds, consumes the day,
Then lost in darkness weeps the hours away.
Here the gay crowd of Luxury advance,
Some touch the lyre, and others urge the dance;
On every head the rosy garland glows,
In every hand the golden goblet flows
The Syren views them with exulting eyes,
And laughs at bashful Virtue as she flies.
But see behind, where Scorn and Want appear,
The grave remonstrance and the witty sneer;
See fell Remorse in action, prompt to dart
Her snaky poison through the conscious heart;
And Sloth to cancel, with oblivious shame,
The fair memorial of recording Fame.

Are these delights that one would wish to gain?
Is this the Elysium of a sober brain?
To wait for happiness in female smiles,
Bear all her scorn, be caught with all her wiles,
With prayers, with bribes, with lies, her pity crave,
Bless her hard bonds, and boast to be her slave;
To feel, for trifles, a distracting train
Of hopes and terrors equally in vain;
This hour to tremble, and the next to glow,
Can Pride, can Sense, can Reason, stoop so low?
When Virtue, at an easier price, displays
The sacred wreaths of honourable praise;
When Wisdom utters her divine decree,
To laugh at pompous Folly, and be free.

I bid adieu, then, to these woful scenes;
I bid adieu to all the sex of queens;
Adieu to every suffering, simple soul,
That lets a woman's will his ease control.
There laugh, ye witty; and rebuke, ye grave!
For me, I scorn to boast that I'm a slave.
I bid the whining brotherhood be gone:
Joy to my heart! my wishes are my own!
Farewell the female heaven, the female hell;
To the great God of Love a glad farewell.
Is this the triumph of thy awful name?
Are these the splendid hopes that urg'd thy aim,
When first my bosom own'd thy haughty sway?
When thus Minerva heard thee boasting, say,
“Go, martial maid, elsewhere thy arts employ,
Nor hope to shelter that devoted boy,
Go teach the solemn sons of Care and Age,
The pensive statesman, and the midnight sage:
The young with me must other lessons prove,
Youth calls for Pleasure, Pleasure calls for Love.
Behold, his heart thy grave advice disdains;
Behold, I bind him in eternal chains.”
Alas! great Love, how idle was the boast!
Thy chains are broken, and thy lessons lost;
Thy wilful rage has tir'd my suffering heart,
And passion, reason, forc'd thee to depart.
But wherefore dost thou linger on thy way?
Why vainly search for some pretence to stay,
When crowds of vassals court thy pleasing yoke,
And countless victims bow them to the stroke?
Lo! round thy shrine a thousand youths advance,
Warm with the gentle ardours of romance;
Each longs to assert thy cause with feats of arms,
And make the world confess Dulcinea's charms.

Ten thousand girls with flowery chaplets crown'd,
To groves and streams thy tender triumph sound:
Each bids the stream in murmurs speak her flame,
Each calls the grove to sigh her shepherd's name.
But, if thy pride such easy honour scorn,
If nobler trophies must thy toil adorn,
Behold yon flowery antiquated maid
Bright in the bloom of threescore years display'd;
Her shalt thou bind in thy delightful chains,
And thrill with gentle pangs her wither'd veins,
Her frosty cheek with crimson blushes dye,
With dreams of rapture melt her maudlin eye.

Turn then thy labours to the servile crowd,
Entice the wary, and control the proud;
Make the sad miser his best gains forego,
The solemn statesman sigh to be a beau,
The bold coquette with fondest passions burn,
The Bacchanalian o'er his bottle mourn;
And that chief glory of thy power maintain,
“To poise ambition in a female brain.”
Be these thy triumphs; but no more presume
That my rebellious heart will yield thee room:
I know thy puny force, thy simple wiles;
I break triumphant through thy flimsy toils;
I see thy dying lamp's last languid glow,
Thy arrows blunted and unbrac'd thy bow.
I feel diviner fires my breast inflame,
To active science, and ingenuous fame;
Resume the paths my earliest choice began,
And lose, with pride, the lover in the man.",Elegy

when you were already dying, 
how they confiscated your piece of land, 
how they decorated the flowery bedrooms of militarymen

how they burned all your books that were related

I re-read your Nobel speech tonight, Neruda—

To vomit gall in slander, swell her veins 
With calumny, that hell itself disdains, 
Is her continual practice ; does her best, 
To tear opinion e'en out of the breast 
Of dearest friends, and—which is worse than vile— 
Sticks jealousy in wedlock ; her own child 
Scapes not the showers of envy. To repeat 
The monstrous fashions how, were alive to eat 
Deare reputation ; would to God she were 
But half so loth to act vice, as to hear
My mild reproof. Lived Mantuan now again 
That female Mastix to limn with his pen, 
This she Chimera that hath eyes of fire, 
Burning with anger—anger feeds desire—
Tongued like the night crow, whose ill boding cries 
Give out for nothing but new injuries ; 
Her breath like to the juice in Tænarus, 
That blasts the springs, though ne'er so prosperous ; 
Her hands, I know not how, used more to spill 
The food of others than herself to fill ; 
But O ! her mind, that Orcus, which includes 
Legions of mischiefs, countless multitudes 
Of formless curses, projects unmade up, 
Abuses yet unfashion'd, thoughts corrupt, 
Misshapen cavils, palpable untroths, 
Inevitable errors, self-accusing loaths. 
These, like those atoms swarming in the sun, 
Throng in her bosom for creation. 
I blush to give her halfe her due ; yet say, 
No poison's half so bad as Julia.",Elegy
53,Kenneth Slessor,Elegy In A Botanic Gardens,"THE smell of birds' nests faintly burning 
Is autumn. In the autumn I came 
Where spring had used me better, 
To the clear red pebbles and the men of stone 
And foundered beetles, to the broken Meleager 
And thousands of white circles drifting past, 
Cold suns in water; even to the dead grove 
Where we had kissed, to the Tristania tree 
Where we had kissed so awkwardly, 
Noted by swans with damp, accusing eyes, 
All gone to-day; only the leaves remain, 
Gaunt paddles ribbed with herringbones 
Of watermelon-pink. Never before 
Had I assented to the hateful name 
Meryta Macrophylla, on a tin tag. 
That was no time for botany. But now the schools, 
The horticulturists, come forth 
Triumphantly with Latin. So be it now, 
Meryta Macrophylla, and the old house, 
Ringed with black stone, no Georgian Headlong Hall 
With glass-eye windows winking candles forth, 
Stuffed with French horns, globes, air-pumps, telescopes 
And Cupid in a wig, playing the flute, 
But truly, and without escape,

Repeated dryly in Roman capitals,

54,John Donne,Elegy Xx (Alternate) Love's War,"Till I have peace with thee, warr other Men, 
And when I have peace, can I leave thee then? 
All other Warrs are scrupulous; Only thou 
0 fayr free Citty, maist thyselfe allow 
To any one: In Flanders, who can tell 
Whether the Master presse; or men rebell? 
Only we know, that which all Ideots say, 
They beare most blows which come to part the fray. 
France in her lunatique giddines did hate 
Ever our men, yea and our God of late; 
Yet she relyes upon our Angels well, 
Which nere returne; no more than they which fell. 
Sick Ireland is with a strange warr possest 
Like to an Ague; now raging, now at rest; 
Which time will cure: yet it must doe her good 
If she were purg'd, and her head vayne let blood. 
And Midas joyes our Spanish journeys give, 
We touch all gold, but find no food to live. 
And I should be in the hott parching clime, 
To dust and ashes turn'd before my time. 
To mew me in a Ship, is to inthrall 
Mee in a prison, that weare like to fall; 
Or in a Cloyster; save that there men dwell 
In a calme heaven, here in a swaggering hell. 
Long voyages are long consumptions, 
And ships are carts for executions. 
Yea they are Deaths; Is't not all one to flye 
Into an other World, as t'is to dye? 
Here lett mee warr; in these armes lett mee lye; 
Here lett mee parle, batter, bleede, and dye. 
Thyne armes imprison me, and myne armes thee, 
Thy hart thy ransome is, take myne for mee. 
Other men war that they their rest may gayne; 
But wee will rest that wee may fight agayne. 
Those warrs the ignorant, these th'experienc'd love, 
There wee are alwayes under, here above. 
There Engins farr off breed a just true feare, 
Neere thrusts, pikes, stabs, yea bullets hurt not here. 
There lyes are wrongs; here safe uprightly ly; 
Tltere men kill men, we'will make one by and by, 
Thou nothing; I not halfe so much shall do 
In these Warrs, as they may which from us two 
Shall spring. Thousands wee see which travaile not 
To warrs; But stay swords, armes, and shott 
To make at home; And shall not I do then 
More glorious service, staying to make men?",Elegy
55,Friedrich Schiller,Elegy On The Death Of A Young Man,"Mournful groans, as when a tempest lowers,
 Echo from the dreary house of woe;
Death-notes rise from yonder minster's towers!
 Bearing out a youth, they slowly go;
Yes! a youth--unripe yet for the bier,
 Gathered in the spring-time of his days,
Thrilling yet with pulses strong and clear,
 With the flame that in his bright eye plays--
Yes, a son--the idol of his mother,
 (Oh, her mournful sigh shows that too well!)
Yes! my bosom-friend,--alas my brother!--
 Up! each man the sad procession swell!

Do ye boast, ye pines, so gray and old,
 Storms to brave, with thunderbolts to sport?
And, ye hills, that ye the heavens uphold?
 And, ye heavens, that ye the suns support!
Boasts the graybeard, who on haughty deeds
 As on billows, seeks perfection's height?
Boasts the hero, whom his prowess leads
 Up to future glory's temple bright!
If the gnawing worms the floweret blast,
 Who can madly think he'll ne'er decay?
Who above, below, can hope to last,
 If the young man's life thus fleets away?

Joyously his days of youth so glad
Danced along, in rosy garb beclad,
 And the world, the world was then so sweet!
And how kindly, how enchantingly
Smiled the future,--with what golden eye
 Did life's paradise his moments greet!
While the tear his mother's eye escaped,
Under him the realm of shadows gaped
 And the fates his thread began to sever,--
Earth and Heaven then vanished from his sight.
From the grave-thought shrank he in affright--
 Sweet the world is to the dying ever!

Dumb and deaf 'tis in that narrow place,
 Deep the slumbers of the buried one!
Brother! Ah, in ever-slackening race
 All thy hopes their circuit cease to run!
Sunbeams oft thy native hill still lave,
 But their glow thou never more canst feel;
O'er its flowers the zephyr's pinions wave,
 O'er thine ear its murmur ne'er can steal;
Love will never tinge thine eye with gold,
 Never wilt thou embrace thy blooming bride,
Not e'en though our tears in torrents rolled--
 Death must now thine eye forever hide!

Yet 'tis well!--for precious is the rest,
 In that narrow house the sleep is calm;
There, with rapture sorrow leaves the breast,--
 Man's afflictions there no longer harm.
Slander now may wildly rave o'er thee,
 And temptation vomit poison fell,
O'er the wrangle on the Pharisee,
 Murderous bigots banish thee to hell!
Rogues beneath apostle-masks may leer,
 And the bastard child of justice play,
As it were with dice, with mankind here,
 And so on, until the judgment day!

O'er thee fortune still may juggle on,
 For her minions blindly look around,--
Man now totter on his staggering throne,
 And in dreary puddles now be found!
Blest art thou, within thy narrow cell!
 To this stir of tragi-comedy,
To these fortune-waves that madly swell,
 To this vain and childish lottery,
To this busy crowd effecting naught,
 To this rest with labor teeming o'er,
Brother!--to this heaven with devils--fraught,
 Now thine eyes have closed forevermore.

Fare thee well, oh, thou to memory dear,
 By our blessings lulled to slumbers sweet!
Sleep on calmly in thy prison drear,--
 Sleep on calmly till again we meet!
Till the loud Almighty trumpet sounds,
 Echoing through these corpse-encumbered hills,
Till God's storm-wind, bursting through the bounds
 Placed by death, with life those corpses fills--
Till, impregnate with Jehovah's blast,
 Graves bring forth, and at His menace dread,
In the smoke of planets melting fast,
 Once again the tombs give up their dead!

Not in worlds, as dreamed of by the wise,
 Not in heavens, as sung in poet's song,
Not in e'en the people's paradise--
 Yet we shall o'ertake thee, and ere long.
Is that true which cheered the pilgrim's gloom?
 Is it true that thoughts can yonder be
True, that virtue guides us o'er the tomb?
 That 'tis more than empty phantasy?
All these riddles are to thee unveiled!
 Truth thy soul ecstatic now drinks up,
Truth in radiance thousandfold exhaled
 From the mighty Father's blissful cup.

Dark and silent bearers draw, then, nigh!
 To the slayer serve the feast the while!
Cease, ye mourners, cease your wailing cry!
 Dust on dust upon the body pile!
Where's the man who God to tempt presumes?
 Where the eye that through the gulf can see?
Holy, holy, holy art thou, God of tombs!
 We, with awful trembling, worship Thee!
Dust may back to native dust be ground,
 From its crumbling house the spirit fly,
And the storm its ashes strew around,--
 But its love, its love shall never die!",Elegy
56,Subbaraman N V,An Elegy,"You were my constant companion
You were my faultless friend
You were my unfailing guide
You were my timely whip! 

You were thick and you were thin
You saw me in my thick and thin! 

You were fed once a month
You fed me all through the month! 

You helped many a friend of mine
You rushed to the unknown strangers too! 

You have seen my days of light and dark
You have warned me lest I went astray! 

Now you are gone where I do not know! 

Is it I could not satisfy your thirst
Is it you could not see me burst
Is it because I did not obey your command
Is it because I did not satisfy your demand? 

How nice you were to see
How lovely you were to me
How good you were to touch
How kind you were as such!

You taught me sense of thrift
You taught me nature of men
You taught me joy of life

And I am of it, the small sharp stars are quite near,
The white moon going among them like a white bird among snow-berries,
And the sound of her gently rustling in heaven like a bird I hear.
 
And I am willing to come to you now, my dear,
As a pigeon lets itself off from a cathedral dome  
To be lost in the haze of the sky, I would like to come,  
And be lost out of sight with you, and be gone like foam.

For I am tired, my dear, and if I could lift my feet,  
My tenacious feet from off the dome of the earth

59,Stephen Vincent Benet,Elegy For An Enemy,"(For G. H.) 

Say, does that stupid earth 
Where they have laid her, 
Bind still her sullen mirth, 
Mirth which betrayed her? 
Do the lush grasses hold, 
Greenly and glad, 
That brittle-perfect gold 
She alone had? 

Smugly the common crew, 
Over their knitting, 
Mourn her -- as butchers do 
Sheep-throats they're slitting! 
She was my enemy, 
One of the best of them. 
Would she come back to me, 
God damn the rest of them! 

Damn them, the flabby, fat, 
Sleek little darlings! 
We gave them tit for tat, 
Snarlings for snarlings! 
Squashy pomposities, 
Shocked at our violence, 
Let not one tactful hiss 
Break her new silence! 

Maids of antiquity, 
Look well upon her; 
Ice was her chastity, 
Spotless her honor. 
Neighbors, with breasts of snow, 
Dames of much virtue, 
How she could flame and glow! 
Lord, how she hurt you! 

She was a woman, and 
Tender -- at times! 
(Delicate was her hand) 
One of her crimes! 
Hair that strayed elfinly, 
Lips red as haws, 
You, with the ready lie, 
Was that the cause?

Slain without fault, 
Life smacks but tastelessly 
Lacking your salt! 
Stuck in a bog whence naught 
May catapult me, 
Come from the grave, long-sought, 
Come and insult me!

61,Jonathan Swift,Elegy On Partridge,"Well; 'tis as Bickerstaff has guess'd,
Though we all took it for a jest:
Partridge is dead; nay more, he died
Ere he could prove the good 'squire lied.
Strange, an astrologer should die
Without one wonder in the sky!
Not one of his crony stars
To pay their duty at his hearse!
No meteor, no eclipse appear'd!
No comet with a flaming beard!
The sun has rose, and gone to bed,
Just as if Partridge were not dead;
Nor hid himself behind the moon
To make a dreadful night at noon.
He at fit periods walks through Aries,
Howe'er our earthly motion varies;
And twice a year he'll cut the equator,
As if there had been no such matter.
Some wits have wonder'd what analogy
There is 'twixt cobbling and astrology;
How Partridge made his optics rise
From a shoe-sole to reach the skies.
A list the cobbler's temples ties,
To keep the hair out of his eyes;
From whence 'tis plain, the diadem
That princes wear derives from them:
And therefore crowns are nowadays
Adorn'd with golden stars and rays:
Which plainly shows the near alliance
'Twixt cobbling and the planets science.
Besides, that slow-pac'd sign Bootes,
As 'tis miscall'd, we know not who 'tis:
But Partridge ended all disputes;
He knew his trade, and call'd it boots.
The horned moon, which heretofore
Upon their shoes the Romans wore,
Whose wideness kept their toes from corns,
And whence we claim our shoeing-horns,
Shows how the art of cobbling bears
A near resemblance to the spheres.
A scrap of parchment hung by geometry
(A great refinement in barometry)
Can, like the stars, foretell the weather;
And what is parchment else but leather?
Which an astrologer might use
Either for almanacs or shoes.
Thus Partridge by his wit and parts
At once did practise both these arts:
And as the boding owl (or rather
The bat, because her wings are leather)
Steals from her private cell by night,
And flies about the candle-light;
So learned Partridge could as well
Creep in the dark from leathern cell,
And in his fancy fly as far
To peep upon a twinkling star.
Besides, he could confound the spheres,
And set the planets by the ears;
To show his skill, he Mars could join
To Venus in aspect malign;
Then call in Mercury for aid,
And cure the wounds that Venus made.
Great scholars have in Lucian read,
When Philip king of Greece was dead,
His soul and spirit did divide,
And each part took a different side:
One rose a star; the other fell
Beneath, and mended shoes in hell.
Thus Partridge still shines in each art,
The cobbling and star-gazing part,
And is install'd as good a star
As any of the Caesars are.
Triumphant star! some pity show
On cobblers militant below,
Whom roguish boys in stormy nights
Torment by pissing out their lights,
Or thro' a chink convey their smoke
Inclos'd artificers to choke.
Thou, high exalted in thy sphere,
May'st follow still thy calling there.
To thee the Bull will lend his hide,
By Phoebus newly tann'd and dry'd:
For thee they Argo's hulk will tax,
And scrape her pitchy sides for wax;
Then Ariadne kindly lends
Her braided hair to make thee ends;
The point of Sagittarius' dart
Turns to an awl by heav'nly art;
And Vulcan, wheedled by his wife,
Will forge for thee a paring-knife.
For want of room by Virgo's side,
She'll strain a point, and sit astride,
To take thee kindly in between;
And then the signs will be thirteen.


THE EPITAPH.

Here, five foot deep, lies on his back
A cobbler, star-monger, and quack;
Who to the stars in pure good-will
Does to his best look upward still.
Weep, all you customers that use
His pills, his almanacs, or shoes:
And you that did your fortunes seek,
Step to his grave but once a week:
This earth, which bears his body's print,
You'll find has so much virtue in't,
That I durst pawn my ears 't will tell
Whate'er concerns you full as well,
In physic, stolen goods, or love,
As he himself could, when above.",Elegy
62,Mary Darby Robinson,"Elegy To The Memory Of Richard Boyle, Esq.","NEAR yon bleak mountain's dizzy height, 
That hangs o'er AVON's silent wave; 
By the pale Crescent's glimm'ring light, 
I sought LORENZO's lonely grave. 

O'er the long grass the silv'ry dew, 
Soft Twilight's tears spontaneous shone; 
And the dank bough of baneful yew 
Supply'd the place of sculptured stone. 

Oft, as my trembling steps drew near, 
The aëry voice of FANCY gave 
The plaint of GENIUS to mine ear, 
That, lingering, murmur'd on his grave. 

""Cold is that heart, where honour glow'd, 
And Friendship's flame sublimely shone, 
And clos'd that eye where Pity flow'd, 
For ev'ry suff'ring but HIS OWN. 

""That form where youth and grace conspir'd, 
To captivate admiring eyes, 
No more belov'd, no more admir'd, 
A torpid mass neglected lies. 

""Mute is the music of that tongue, 
Once tuneful as the voice of love, 
When ORPHEUS, by his magic song, 
Taught trees, and flinty rocks to move. 

""Oft shall the pensive MUSE be found, 
Sprinkling with flow'rs his mould'ring clay; 
While soft-eyed SORROW wand'ring round, 
Shall pluck intruding weeds away."" 

Sad victim of the sordid mind, 
That doom'd THEE to an early grave; 
Ne'er shall HER breast that pity find, 
Which thy forgiveness nobly gave! 

Thou, who, when SORROW'S icy hand 
Forbad the healthsome pulse to flow, 
Obedient to HER stern command, 
With meek submission bow'd thee low! 

And when thy faded cheek proclaim'd 
The thorn that rankled in thy breast, 
Thy steady soul that pride maintain'd, 
Which marks the godlike mind distress'd! 

Nor was thy mental strength subdu'd, 
When HOPE's last ling'ring shadows fled, 
Unchang'd, thy dauntless spirit view'd 
The dreary confines of the dead! 

And when thy penetrating mind, 
Life's thorny maze presum'd to scan, 
In ev'ry path condemn'd to find 
""The low ingratitude of man."" 

Indignant would'st thou turn away, 
And smiling raise thy languid eye, 
And oft thy feeble voice would say, 
""TO ME 'TIS HAPPINESS TO DIE.""

And tho' thy FRIEND, I with skilful art, 
To heal thy woes, each balm apply'd; 
Tho' the fine feelings of his heart, 
Nor cost nor studious care deny'd! 

He saw the fatal hour draw near, 
He saw THEE fading to the grave; 
He gave his last kind gift, A TEAR, 
And mourn'd the worth he could not save. 

Nor could the ruthless breath of FATE 
Snatch from thy grave the tender sigh; 
Nor a relentless monster's hate 
Impede thy passage to the sky. 

And tho' no kindred tears were shed, 
No tribute to thy memory giv'n; 
Sublime in death, thy spirit fled, 
To seek its best reward IN HEAVEN!",Elegy
63,John Donne,Elegy Xi: The Bracelet,"Upon the Loss of His Mistress’s Chain, for Which He Made Satisfaction

NOT that in colour it was like thy hair,
For armlets of that thou mayst let me wear; 
Nor that thy hand it oft embraced and kiss'd,
For so it had that good, which oft I miss'd; 
Nor for that silly old morality,
That, as these links were knit, our love should be,
Mourn I that I thy sevenfold chain have lost; 
Nor for the luck sake; but the bitter cost.
O, shall twelve righteous angels, which as yet
No leaven of vile solder did admit; 
Nor yet by any way have stray'd or gone
From the first state of their creation; 
Angels, which heaven commanded to provide
All things to me, and be my faithful guide; 
To gain new friends, to appease great enemies; 
To comfort my soul, when I lie or rise; 
Shall these twelve innocents, by thy severe
Sentence, dread judge, my sin's great burden bear? 
Shall they be damn'd, and in the furnace thrown,
And punish'd for offenses not their own? 
They save not me, they do not ease my pains,
When in that hell they're burnt and tied in chains.
Were they but crowns of France, I carèd not,
For most of these their country's natural rot,
I think, possesseth; they come here to us
So pale, so lame, so lean, so ruinous.
And howsoe'er French kings most Christian be,
Their crowns are circumcised most Jewishly.
Or were they Spanish stamps, still travelling,
That are become as Catholic as their king; 
These unlick'd bear-whelps, unfiled pistolets,
That—more than cannon shot—avails or lets; 
Which, negligently left unrounded, look
Like many-angled figures in the book
Of some great conjurer that would enforce
Nature, so these do justice, from her course; 
Which, as the soul quickens head, feet and heart,
As streams, like veins, run through th' earth's every part,
Visit all countries, and have slily made
Gorgeous France, ruin'd, ragged and decay'd,
Scotland, which knew no state, proud in one day,
And mangled seventeen-headed Belgia.
Or were it such gold as that wherewithal
Almighty chemics, from each mineral
Having by subtle fire a soul out-pull'd,
Are dirtily and desperately gull'd; 
I would not spit to quench the fire they're in,
For they are guilty of much heinous sin.
But shall my harmless angels perish? Shall
I lose my guard, my ease, my food, my all? 
Much hope which they would nourish will be dead.
Much of my able youth, and lustihead
Will vanish; if thou love, let them alone,
For thou wilt love me less when they are gone; 
And be content that some loud squeaking crier,
Well-pleas'd with one lean threadbare groat, for hire,
May like a devil roar through every street,
And gall the finder's conscience, if he meet.
Or let me creep to some dread conjurer,
That with fantastic schemes fills full much paper; 
Which hath divided heaven in tenements,
And with whores, thieves, and murderers stuff'd his rents
So full, that though he pass them all in sin,
He leaves himself no room to enter in.
But if, when all his art and time is spent,
He say 'twill ne'er be found; yet be content; 
Receive from him that doom ungrudgingly,
Because he is the mouth of destiny.
Thou say'st, alas! the gold doth still remain,
Though it be changed, and put into a chain.
So in the first fallen angels resteth still
Wisdom and knowledge, but 'tis turn'd to ill; 
As these should do good works, and should provide
Necessities; but now must nurse thy pride.
And they are still bad angels; mine are none; 
For form gives being, and their form is gone.
Pity these angels yet; their dignities
Pass Virtues, Powers, and Principalities.
But thou art resolute; thy will be done; 
Yet with such anguish, as her only son
The mother in the hungry grave doth lay,
Unto the fire these martyrs I betray.
Good souls—for you give life to everything—
Good angels—for good messages you bring—
Destined you might have been to such an one,
As would have loved and worshipp'd you alone; 
One that would suffer hunger, nakedness,
Yea death, ere he would make your number less; 
But, I am guilty of your sad decay; 
May your few fellows longer with me stay.
But O! thou wretched finder whom I hate
So, that I almost pity thy estate,
Gold being the heaviest metal amongst all,
May my most heavy curse upon thee fall.
Here fetter'd, manacled, and hang'd in chains,
First mayst thou be; then chain'd to hellish pains; 
Or be with foreign gold bribed to betray
Thy country, and fail both of it and thy pay.
May the next thing thou stoop'st to reach, contain
Poison, whose nimble fume rot thy moist brain; 
Or libels, or some interdicted thing,
Which negligently kept thy ruin bring.
Lust-bred diseases rot thee; and dwell with thee
Itching desire, and no ability.
May all the evils that gold ever wrought; 
All mischief that all devils ever thought; 
Want after plenty, poor and gouty age,
The plagues of travellers, love, marriage
Afflict thee, and at thy life's last moment,
May thy swollen sins themselves to thee present.
But, I forgive; repent thee, honest man! 
Gold is restorative; restore it then:
But if from it thou be'st loth to depart,
Because 'tis cordial, would 'twere at thy heart.",Elegy

I pour to winds and waves the unheeded tear,
Try with vain effort to submit to Heaven,
And fruitless call on him--'who cannot hear.'
'Oh! might I fondly clasp him once again,
While o'er my head the infuriate billows pour,
Forget in death this agonizing pain,
And feel his father's cruelty no more!
'Part, raging waters! part, and show beneath,
In your dread caves, his pale and mangled form;
Now, while the demons of despair and death
Ride on the blast, and urge the howling storm:

'Lo! by the lightning's momentary blaze,
I see him rise the whitening waves above,
No longer such as when in happier days
He gave the enchanted hours--to me and love.
'Such, as when daring the enchafed sea,
And courting dangerous toil, he often said
That every peril, one soft smile from me,
One sigh of speechless tenderness o'erpaid.
'But dead, disfigured, while between the roar
Of the loud waves his accents pierce mine ear,
And seem to say--Ah, wretch! delay no more,
But come, unhappy mourner--meet me here.
'Yet, powerful Fancy, bid the phantom stay,
Still let me hear him!--'Tis already past;
Along the waves his shadow glides away,
I lose his voice amid the deafening blast.
'Ah, wild delusion, born of frantic pain!
He hears not, comes not from his watery bed;
My tears, my anguish, my despair are vain,
The insatiate ocean gives not up its dead.
' 'Tis not his voice! Hark! the deep thunders roll;
Upheaves the ground; the rocky barriers fail;
Approach, ye horrors that delight my soul,
Despair, and Death, and Desolation, hail!'
The Ocean hears--The embodied waters come--
Rise o'er the land, and with resistless sweep
Tear from its base the proud aggressor's tomb,
And bear the injured to eternal sleep.",Elegy
65,John Donne,Elegy Xii,"COME Fates ; I fear you not ! All whom I owe
Are paid, but you ; then 'rest me ere I go.
But Chance from you all sovereignty hath got ;
Love woundeth none but those whom Death dares not ;
True if you were, and just in equity,
I should have vanquish'd her, as you did me ;
Else lovers should not brave Death's pains, and live ;
But 'tis a rule, “ Death comes not to relieve.”
Or, pale and wan Death's terrors, are they laid
So deep in lovers, they make Death afraid ?
Or—the least comfort—have I company ?
O'ercame she Fates, Love, Death, as well as me ?
Yes, Fates do silk unto her distaff pay,
For ransom, which tax they on us do lay.
Love gives her youth—which is the reason why
Youths, for her sake, some wither and some die.
Poor Death can nothing give ; yet, for her sake,
Still in her turn, he doth a lover take.
And if Death should prove false, she fears him not ;
Our Muses, to redeem her, she hath got.
That fatal night we last kiss'd, I thus pray'd,
—Or rather, thus despair'd, I should have said—
Kisses, and yet despair ! The forbid tree
Did promise (and deceive) no more than she.
Like lambs, that see their teats, and must eat hay,
A food, whose taste hath made me pine away.
Dives, when thou saw'st bliss, and craved'st to touch
A drop of water, thy great pains were such.
Here grief wants a fresh wit, for mine being spent,
And my sighs weary, groans are all my rent.
Unable longer to endure the pain,
They break like thunder, and do bring down rain.
Thus till dry tear solder my eye, I weep ;
And then, I dream, how you securely sleep,
And in your dreams do laugh at me. I hate,
And pray Love all may ; he pities my state,
But says, I therein no revenge shall find ;
The sun would shine, though all the world were blind.
Yet, to try my hate, Love show'd me your tear ;
And I had died, had not your smile been there.
Your frown undoes me ; your smile is my wealth ;
And as you please to look, I have my health.
Methought, Love pitying me, when he saw this,
Gave me your hands, the backs and palms to kiss.
That cured me not, but to bear pain gave strength ;
And what is lost in force, is took in length.
I call'd on Love again, who fear'd you so,
That his compassion still proved greater woe ;
For, then I dream'd I was in bed with you,
But durst not feel, for fear it should not be true.
This merits not your anger, had it been ;
The queen of chastity was naked seen ;
And in bed not to feel, the pain I took,
Was more than for Actæon not to look ;
And that breast which lay ope, I did not know,
But for the clearness, from a lump of snow ;
Nor that sweet teat which on the top it bore
From the rose-bud which for my sake you wore.
These griefs to issue forth, by verse I prove ;
Or turn their course by travel and new love.
All would not do ; the best at last I tried ;
Unable longer to hold out, I died.
And then I found I lost life, death by flying ;
Who hundreds live, are but so long in dying.
Charon did let me pass ; I'll him requite.
To mark the groves or shades wrongs my delight ;
I'll speak but of those ghosts I found alone,
Those thousand ghosts, whereof myself made one,
All images of thee ; I asked them why ?
The judge told me, all they for thee did die,
And therefore had for their Elysian bliss,
In one another their own loves to kiss.
O here I miss'd not blissh, but being dead ;
For lo ! I dreamt, I dreamt, and waking said,
“ Heaven, if who are in thee there must dwell,
How is't I now was there, and now I fell ?”",Elegy
66,Amelia Opie,"Love Elegy, To Laura","Too heedless friend, why thus augment the flame
That glows resistless in my beating breast?
Why with thy praises grace his fatal name,
Who robs thy Emma's hapless heart of rest?

Why needest thou dwell on Henry's graceful ease;
Why praise the timid worth his glance reveals;
Why speak enraptured of his power to please,
Whose power to wound my aching bosom feels?

Say not, ""That gentle voice was formed for love,""
Nor in his eyes such sweet expression see;
Say not, that tenderness those glances prove,
Which never fix with tenderness on me.

Too well my Henry's charms I've numbered o'er,
And thus to end the fond survey is mine:
His heart will own some brighter fair one's power;
Think not, lost Emma, he can e'er be thine.

Yet why despair? Though Beauty's boasted rose
On others' cheeks in livelier colours shine,
The tender heart that in my bosom glows
The palm of fondness will to none resign.

Though brighter radiance beams in others' eyes,
By shape, by colour formed the soul to steal;
If Love's expression Henry's heart can prize,
Then, Henry's heart the power of mine must feel.

Yet vain the hope: ""Fond maid, thy love suppress,""
Calm Reason cries; ""go, learn to check the sigh:
But, if resolved to love in rash excess,
Seek out some lonely shade, despair, and die!""

Then, Laura, bid to Henry's praise farewel!
Forget his merit, and my hopeless flame;
On the dear theme no more ill-judging dwell,
And from thy memory blot his fatal name.

But if I urge this plaintive prayer in vain,
Bid execrations on that name attend;
And him, my Laura, view with cold disdain,
Who sees unmoved the sorrows of thy friend.

Say, such the scorn, the pride of Henry's breast,
It cannot Love's endearing softness share,
Say, vice degrades....Hold! slight my wild request,
Nor by such calumny my fury dare.

No....from my frantic wishes still appeal,
Declare that Henry is from error free;
Or the keen hate for him I bade thee feel,
My wayward heart will learn to feel for thee.",Elegy
67,Mary Darby Robinson,Elegy To The Memory Of Werter,"""With female Fairies will thy tomb be haunted

WHEN from Day's closing eye the lucid tears
Fall lightly on the bending lily's head;
When o'er the blushing sky night's curtains spread, 
And the tall mountain's summit scarce appears;
When languid Evening, sinking to repose,
Her filmy mantle o'er the landscape throws; 
Of THEE I'll sing; and as the mournful song 
Glides in slow numbers the dark woods among; 
My wand'ring steps shall seek the lonely shade, 
Where all thy virtues, all thy griefs are laid! 

Yes, hopeless suff'rer, friendless and forlorn,
Sweet victim of love's power; the silent tear
Shall oft at twilight's close, and glimm'ring morn
Gem the pale primrose that adorns thy bier, 
And as the balmy dew ascends to heaven, 
Thy crime shall steal away, thy frailty be forgiv'n. 

Oft by the moon's wan beam the love-lorn maid,
Led by soft SYMPATHY, shall stroll along;
Oft shall she listen in the Lime-tree's * shade,
Her cold blood freezing at the night-owl's song:
Or, when she hears the death-bell's solemn sound,
Her light steps echoing o'er the hollow ground;
Oft shall the trickling tear adorn her cheek,
Thy pow'r, O SENSIBILITY ! in magic charms to speak! 

For the poor PILGRIM, doom'd afar to roam
From the dear comforts of his native home,
A glitt'ring star puts forth a silv'ry ray,
Soothes his sad heart, and marks his tedious way;
The short-liv'd radiance cheers the gloom of night,
And decks Heaven's murky dome with transitory light. 

So from the mournful CHARLOTTE's dark-orb'd lids,
The sainted tear of pitying VIRTUE flows; 
And the last boon, the ""churlish priest"" forbids,
On thy lone grave the sacred drop bestows;
There shall the sparkling dews of Evening shine,
AND HEAVEN'S OWN INCENSE CONSECRATE THE SHRINE.",Elegy
68,Robert Burns,Poor Mailie's Elegy,"Lament in rhyme, lament in prose, 
Wi' saut tears tricklin down your nose;

Past a' remead! 
The last, sad cape-stane o' his woes;

It's no the loss o' warl's gear,

Fast by the rivulet's sleep-persuading sound,
Where 'sleeps the moonlight' on yon verdant bed--
O humbly press that consecrated ground!

For there does Edmund rest, the learned swain!
And there his spirit most delights to rove:
Young Edmund! famed for each harmonious strain,
And the sore wounds of ill-requited love.

Like some tall tree that spreads its branches wide,
And loads the west wind with its soft perfume,
His manhood blossomed: till the faithless pride
Of fair Matilda sank him to the tomb.

But soon did righteous Heaven her guilt pursue!
Where'er with wildered step she wandered pale,
Still Edmund's image rose to blast her view,
Still Edmund's voice accused her in each gale.

With keen regret, and conscious guilt's alarms,
Amid the pomp of affluence she pined;
Nor all that lured her faith from Edmund's arms
Could lull the wakeful horror of her mind.

Go, Traveller! tell the tale with sorrow fraught:
Some tearful maid perchance, or blooming youth,
May hold it in remembrance; and be taught
That riches cannot pay for Love or Truth.",Elegy
70,John Dryden,On The Death Of Amyntas. A Pastoral Elegy,"'Twas on a joyless and a gloomy morn, 
Wet was the grass, and hung with pearls the thorn, 
When Damon, who designed to pass the day 
With hounds and horns, and chase the flying prey, 
Rose early from his bed; but soon he found 
The welkin pitched with sullen clouds around, 
An eastern wind, and dew upon the ground. 
Thus while he stood, and sighing did survey 
The fields, and curst the ill omens of the day, 
He saw Menalcas come with heavy pace: 
Wet were his eyes, and cheerless was his face: 
He wrung his hands, distracted with his care, 
And sent his voice before him from afar. 
“Return,” he cried, “return, unhappy swain, 
The spongy clouds are filled with gathering rain: 
The promise of the day not only crossed, 
But even the spring, the spring itself is lost. 
Amyntas—oh!”—he could not speak the rest, 
Nor needed, for presaging Damon guessed. 
Equal with heaven young Damon loved the boy, 
The boast of nature, both his parents' joy. 
His graceful form revolving in his mind; 
So great a genius, and a soul so kind, 
Gave sad assurance that his fears were true; 
Too well the envy of the gods he knew: 
For when their gifts too lavishly are placed, 
Soon they repent, and will not make them last. 
For sure it was too bountiful a dole, 
The mother's features, and the father's soul. 
Then thus he cried:—“The morn bespoke the news; 
The morning did her cheerful light diffuse; 
But see how suddenly she changed her face, 
And brought on clouds and rain, the day's disgrace; 
Just such, Amyntas, was thy promised race. 
What charms adorned thy youth, where nature smiled, 
And more than man was given us in a child! 
His infancy was ripe; a soul sublime 
In years so tender that prevented time: 
Heaven gave him all at once; then snatched away, 
Ere mortals all his beauties could survey; 
Just like the flower that buds and withers in a day.” 

MENALCAS.
The mother, lovely, though with grief opprest, 
Reclined his dying head upon her breast. 
The mournful family stood all around; 
One groan was heard, one universal sound: 
All were in floods of tears and endless sorrow drowned. 
So dire a sadness sat on every look, 
Even Death repented he had given the stroke. 
He grieved his fatal work had been ordained, 
But promised length of life to those who yet remained. 
The mother's and her eldest daughter's grace, 
It seems, had bribed him to prolong their space. 
The father bore it with undaunted soul, 
Like one who durst his destiny control; 
Yet with becoming grief he bore his part, 
Resigned his son, but not resigned his heart. 
Patient as Job; and may he live to see, 
Like him, a new increasing family! 

DAMON.
Such is my wish, and such my prophecy; 
For yet, my friend, the beauteous mould remains; 
Long may she exercise her fruitful pains! 
But, ah! with better hap, and bring a race 
More lasting, and endued with equal grace! 
Equal she may, but farther none can go; 
For he was all that was exact below. 

MENALCAS.
Damon, behold yon breaking purple cloud; 
Hear'st thou not hymns and songs divinely loud? 
There mounts Amyntas; the young cherubs play 
About their godlike mate, and sing him on his way. 
He cleaves the liquid air; behold, he flies, 
And every moment gains upon the skies. 
The new-come guest admires the ethereal state, 
The sapphire portal, and the golden gate; 
And now admitted in the shining throng, 
He shows the passport which he brought along. 
His passport is his innocence and grace, 
Well known to all the natives of the place. 
Now sing, ye joyful angels, and admire 
Your brother's voice that comes to mend your quire: 
Sing you, while endless tears our eyes bestow; 
For, like Amyntas, none is left below.",Elegy
71,James Thomson,An Elegy On Parting,"It was a sad, ay 'twas a sad farewell, 
I still afresh the pangs of parting feel; 
Against my breast my heart impatient beat, 
And in deep sighs bemoan'd its cruel fate; 
Thus with the object of my love to part, 
My life! my joy! 'twould rend a rocky heart. 
Where'er I turn myself, where'er I go, 
I meet the image of my lovely foe; 
With witching charms the phantom still appears, 
And with her wanton smiles insults my tears; 
Still haunts the places where we used to walk, 
And where with raptures oft I heard her talk: 
Those scenes I now with deepest sorrow view, 
And sighing bid to all delight adieu. 
While I my head upon this turf recline, 
Officious sun, in vain on me you shine; 
In vain unto the smiling fields I hie; 
In vain the flowery meads salute my eye; 
In vain the cheerful birds and shepherds sing, 
And with their carols make the valleys ring; 
Yea, all the pleasure that the country yield 
Can't me from sorrow for her absence shield; 
With divine pleasure books which one inspire, 
Yea, books themselves I do not now admire. 
But hark! methinks some pitying power I hear, 
This welcome message whisper in my ear: 
‘Forget thy groundless griefs, dejected swain, 
You and the nymph you love shall meet again; 
No more your muse shall sing such mournful lays, 
But bounteous heaven and your kind mistress praise.’",Elegy
72,Ben Jonson,An Elegy,"THOUGH beauty be the mark of praise, 
And yours of whom I sing be such 
As not the world can praise too much, 
Yet 'tis your Virtue now I raise. 

A virtue, like allay so gone 
Throughout your form as, though that move 
And draw and conquer all men's love, 
This subjects you to love of one. 

Wherein you triumph yet-because 
'Tis of your flesh, and that you use 
The noblest freedom, not to choose 
Against or faith or honour's laws. 

But who should less expect from you? 
In whom alone Love lives again: 
By whom he is restored to men, 
And kept and bred and brought up true. 

His falling temples you have rear'd, 
The wither'd garlands ta'en away; 
His altars kept from that decay 
That envy wish'd, and nature fear'd: 

And on them burn so chaste a flame, 
With so much loyalty's expense, 
As Love to acquit such excellence 
Is gone himself into your name. 

And you are he-the deity 
To whom all lovers are design'd 
That would their better objects find; 
Among which faithful troop am I- 

Who as an off'ring at your shrine 
Have sung this hymn, and here entreat 
One spark of your diviner heat 
To light upon a love of mine. 

Which if it kindle not, but scant 
Appear, and that to shortest view; 
Yet give me leave to adore in you 
What I in her am grieved to want!",Elegy
73,Percy Bysshe Shelley,Fragment Of The Elegy On The Death Of Bion,"From the Greek of Moschus.

Ye Dorian woods and waves, lament aloud,--
Augment your tide, O streams, with fruitless tears,
For the beloved Bion is no more.
Let every tender herb and plant and flower,
From each dejected bud and drooping bloom, 
Shed dews of liquid sorrow, and with breath
Of melancholy sweetness on the wind
Diffuse its languid love; let roses blush,
Anemones grow paler for the loss
Their dells have known; and thou, O hyacinth, 
Utter thy legend now--yet more, dumb flower,
Than 'Ah! alas!'--thine is no common grief--
Bion the [sweetest singer] is no more.",Elegy
74,George Gordon Byron,Elegy On Newstead Abbey,"'It is the voice of years that are gone! 
they roll before me with all their deeds.'~OSSIAN


Newstead! fast-falling, once-resplendent dome!
Religion's shrine! repentant HENRY's pride!
Of warriors, monks, and dames the cloister'd tomb,
Whose pensive shades around thy ruins glide,
Hail to thy pile! more honour'd in thy fall
Than modern mansions in their pillar'd state;
Proudly majestic frowns thy vaulted hall, 
Scowling defiance on the blasts of fate.

No mail-clad serfs, obedient to their lord, 
In grim array the crimson cross demand;
Or gay assemble round the festive board 
Their chief's retainers, an immortal band:

Else might inspiting Fancy's magic eye 
Retrace their progress through the lapse of time,
Marking each ardent youth, ordaln'd to die,
A votive pilgrim in Judea's clime.

But not from thee, dark pile! departs the chief;
His feudal realm in other regions lay:
In thee the wounded conscience courts relief,
Retiring from the garish blare of day.

Yes! in thy gloomy cells and shades profound
The monk abjured a world he ne'er could view;
Or blood-stain'd guilt repenting solace found,
Or innocence from stern oppression flew.

A monarch bade thee from that wild arise,
Where Sherwood's outlaws once were wont to prowl;
And Superstition's crimes, of various dyes,
Sought shelter in the priest's protecting cowl.

Where now the grass exhales a murky dew,
The humid pail of life-extinguish'd clay,
In sainted fame the sacred fathers grew, 
Nor raised their pious voices but to pray.

Where now the bats their wavering wings extend
Soon as the gloaming spreads her waning shade,
The choir did oft their mingling vespers blend,
Or matin orisons to Mary pald.

Years roll on years; to ages, ages yield; 
Abbots to abbots, in a line, succeed;
Religion's charter their protecting shield, 
Till royal sacrilege their doom decreed,
One holy HENRY rear'd the Gothic walls, 
And bade the pious inmates rest in peace
Another HENRY the kind gift recalls, 
And bids devotion's hallow'd echos cease.

Vain is each threat or supplicating prayer; 
He drives them exiles from their blest abode,
To roam a dreary world in deep despair —
No friend, no home, no refuge, but their God.

Hark how the hall, resounding to the strain
Shakes with the martial music's novel din!
The heralds of a warrior's haughty reign, 
High crested banners wave thy wails within.

Of changing sentinels the distant hum, 
The mirth of feasts, the clang of burnish'd arms,
The braying trumpet and the hoarser drum,
Unite in concert with increased alarms.

An abbey once, a regal fortress now, 
Encircled by insulting rebel powers,
War's dread machines o'erhang thy threat'ning brow,
And dart destruction in sulphureous showers.

Ah vain defence! the hostile traitor's siege, 
Though oft repulsed, by guile o'er-comes the brave;
His thronging foes oppress the faithful liege,
Rebellion's reeking standards o'er him wave.

Not unavenged the raging baron yields; 
The blood of traitors smears the purple plain
Unconqu'r'd still, his falchion there he wields,
And days of glory yet for him remain.

Still in that hour the warrior wish'd to strew
Self-gather'd laurel on a self-sought grave;
But Charles' protecting genius hither flew, 
The monarch's friend, the monarch's hope, to save.

Trembling, she snatch'd him ftom th' unequal strife,
In other fields the torrent to repel; 
For nobler combats, here reservedhis life,
To lead the hand where godlike FALKLAND fell
From thee, poor pile! to lawless plunder given,
While dying groans their painful requiem sound,
Far different incense now ascends to heaven,
Such victims wallow on the gory ground.

There many a pale and ruthless robber's corse,
Noisome and ghast, defiles thy sacred sod;
O'er mingling man, and horse commix'd with horse,
Corruption's heap, the savage spoilers trod.

Graves, long with rank and sighing weeds o'erspread,
Ransack'd, resign perforce their mortal mould:
From ruffian fangs escape not e'en the dead,
Raked from repose in search of buried gold.

Hush'd is the harp, unstrung the warlike lyre'
The minstrel's palsied hand reclines in death; 
No more he strikes the quivering chords with fire,
Or sings the glories of the martial wreath.

At length the sated murderers, gorged with prey,
Retire: the clamour of the fight is o'er; 
Silence again resumes her awful sway, 
And sable Horror guards the massy door.

Here Desolation holds her dreary court:
What satellites declare her dismal reign! 
Shrieking their dirge, ill-omen'd birds resort,
To flit their vigils in the hoary fane. 

Soon a new morn's restoring beams dispel
The clouds of anarchy from Britain's skies;
The fierce usurper seeks his native hell, 
And Nature triumphs as the tyrant dies.

With storms she welcomes his expiring groans 
Whirlwinds, responsive, greet his labouring breath;
Earth shudders as her caves receive his bones,
Loathing the offering of so dark a death.

The legal ruler now resumes the helm, 
He guides through gentle seas the prow of state
Hope cheers, with wonted smiles, the peaceful realm,
And heals the bleeding wounds of wearied hate. 

The gloomy tenants, Newstead! of thy cells,
Howling, resign their violated nest; 
Again the master on his tenure dwells, 
Enjoy'd, from absence, with enraptured zest.

Vassals, within thy hospitable pale, 
Loudly carousing, bless their lord's return.
Culture again adorns the gladdening vale, 
And matrons, once lamenting, cease to mourn.

A thousand songs on tuneful echo float, 
Unwonted foliage mantles o'er the trees;
And hark! the horns proclalm a mellow note,
The hunters' cry hangs lengthening on the breeze.

Beneath their coursers' hoofs the valleys shake:
What fears, what anxious hopes attend the chase!
The dying stag seeks refuge in the lake;
Exulting shouts announce the finish'd race.

Ah happy days! too happy to endure! 
Such simple sports our plain forefathers knew
No splendid vices glitter'd to allure; 
Their joys were many, as their cares were few.

From these descending, sons to sires succeed
Time steals along, and Death uprears the dart;
Another chief impels the foaming steed, 
Another crowd pursue the panting hart.

Newstead! what saddening change of scene is thine!
Thy yawning arch betokens slow decay; 
The last and youngest of a noble line
Now holds thy mouldering turrets in his sway.

Deserted now, he scans thy gray worn towers;
Thy vaults, where dead of feudal ages sleep;
Thy cloisters, pervious to the wintry showers
These, these he views, and views them but to weep.

Yet are his tears no emblem of regret:
Cherish'd affection only bids them flow.
Pride, hope, and love forbid him to forget 
But warm his bosom with irnpassion'd glow.

Yet he prefers thee to the gilded domes 
Or gewgaw grottos of the vainly great,
Yet lingers 'mid thy damp and mossy tombs,
Nor breathes a murmur 'gainst the will of fate.

Haply thy sun, emerging, yet may shine, 
Thee to irradiate with meridian ray;
Hours splendid as the past may still be thine,
And bless thy future as thy former day.",Elegy
75,Theodora (Theo) Onken,(((A  Summer  Elegy))),"&gt;The flowers are now shattered
Their thorns bleed the rose
A Basket full of withered Daisies
Where the wild sunflower still grows; 

'Tis a backfall of listless last days
Oh, the grey simply swallows you
Gone are the blistering days of Summer
As Autumns amber breaks in anew; 

The shadows growing e'er longer
Gold and russet leaves fly away
Surounded by temporary graves for the Tulip
No where for the Meadow Lark to play;

While the dew, too soon, becomes frost
Woeful cries stir from all of Nature
In mourning, for Summer Days, now lost;

76,Amelia Opie,"Love Elegy, To Henry","Then thou hast learnt the secret of my soul,
Officious Friendship has its trust betrayed;
No more I need the bursting sigh control,
Nor summon pride my struggling soul to aid.

But think not banished hope returns again,
Think not I write thy thankless heart to move;
The faded form that tells my tender pain
May win thy pity, but it can't thy love.

Nor can I move thee by soft winning art,
By manners taught to charm, or practised glance;
Artless as thine, my too too feeling heart
Disdains the tutored eye, the fond advance.

The cold coquette, to win her destined prey,
May feign a passion which she ne'er can feel;
But I true Passion's soft commands obey,
And fain my tender feelings would conceal.

In others' eyes, when fixed on thine, I see
That fondness painted which alone I know;
Think not, my Henry, they can love like me,
More love I hide than they can e'er bestow. 

While tender glances their emotions speak,
And oft they heave and oft suppress the sigh;
O turn to me, behold my pallid cheek 
Shrinking from thine, behold my downcast eye!

While they by mirth, by wit, thine ear amuse,
And by their eloquence thy plaudits seek;
See me the fond contention still refuse,
Nor in thy presence, Henry, dare to speak.

When asked to breathe the soul-enchanting song,
See them o'erjoyed exert their utmost art;
While vainly I would join the choral throng,
Lost are those tones which once could touch the heart.

But, Henry, wert thou in Love's language wise,
Vainly would others more than Emma shine;
Beyond their sweetest strains thy heart would prize
One faint, one broken, tender tone of mine.

O proofs of passion, eloquent as vain!
By thee unheeded, or perhaps unknown,....
But learn, the pangs that prompt this pensive strain,
Ere long, disdainful youth, may be thine own.

Ah! no....in hopeless love thou canst not pine,
Thou ne'er canst woo the brightest maid in vain;
For thee Love's star midst cloudless skies will shine,
And light thy graceful steps to Hymen's fane:

While I, as hope, and strength, and life recede,
Far, far from thee shall waste the languid day;
Blest, if the scroll that speaks thy bliss I read,
But far more blest to feel life's powers decay.",Elegy
77,Mary Darby Robinson,Elegy On The Death Of Lady Middleton,"THE knell of death, that on the twilight gale, 
Swells its deep murmur to the pensive ear; 
In awful sounds repeats a mournful tale, 
And claims the tribute of a tender tear. 

The dreadful hour is past ! the mandate giv'n! 
The gentle MIDDLETON shall breathe no more, 
Yet who shall blame the wise decrees of Heaven, 
Or the dark mysteries of Fate explore? 

No more her converse shall delight the heart; 
No more her smile benign spread pleasure round; 
No more her liberal bosom shall impart 
The balm of pity to Affliction's wound. 

Her soul above the pride of noble birth, 
Above the praises of an empty name, 
By graceful MEEKNESS mark'd superior worth, 
By peerless VIRTUES claim'd the fairest fame, 

Nor did those Virtues flaunt their innate rays, 
To court applause, or charm the vulgar throng, 
No ostentatious glare illum'd her days, 
No idle boast escap'd her tuneful tongue. 

When FAME, ambitious to record her praise, 
On glitt'ring pinions spread her name afar, 
Her gentle nature shunn'd the dazzling blaze, 
Mild as the lustre of the morning star! 

DIVINE BENEVOLENCE around her shone! 
The chastest manners spoke her spotless mind; 
That Pow'r who gave now claims her for his own, 
Pure as the cherub she has left behind.

As round her couch the winged darts of death 
Reluctant flew from Fate's unerring bow, 
Immortal angels claim'd her quivering breath, 
And snatch'd her spirit from a world of woe. 

Calm resignation smil'd upon her cheek, 
And HOPE'S refulgent beam illum'd her eye; 
While FAITH, celestial VIRTUE'S handmaid meek, 
On wings of seraphs bore her to the sky. 

Ye poor, who from her gen'rous bounty fed; 
Oh! to HER mem'ry give the fame that's due; 
For oft, from pleasure's blithe meanders led, 
Her pensive bosom felt a pang for YOU. 

Yet, cease to mourn a sainted Spirit gone 
To seek its resting place, beyond the skies; 
Where 'midst the glories of TH' ETERNAL's throne, 
She tastes celestial bliss THAT NEVER DIES!",Elegy
78,Henry King,An Elegy Upon The Most Victorious King O..,"Like a cold fatal sweat which ushers death 
My thoughts hang on me, &amp; my lab'ring breath 
Stopt up with sighs, my fancie big with woes, 
Feels two twinn'd mountains struggle in her throws, 
Of boundless sorrow one, t'other of sin; 
For less let no one rate it to begin 
Where honour ends. In Great Gustavus flame 
That style burnt out, and wasted to a name, 
Does barely live with us. As when the stuff 
That fed it failes, the Taper turns to snuff. 
With this poor snuff, this ayerie shadow, we 
Of Fame and Honour must contented be; 
Since from the vain grasp of our wishes fled 
Their glorious substance is, now He is dead. 
Speak it again, and louder, louder yet; 
Else whil'st we hear the sound we shall forget 
What it delivers. Let hoarse rumor cry 
Till she so many ecchoes multiply, 
Those may like num'rous witnesses confute 
Our unbelieving soules, that would dispute 
And doubt this truth for ever. This one way 
Is left our incredulity to sway; 
To waken our deaf sense, and make our ears 
As open and dilated as our fears; 
That we may feel the blow, and feeling grieve, 
At what we would not feign, but must believe. 
And in that horrid faith behold the world 
From her proud height of expectation hurl'd, 
Stooping with him, as if she strove to have 
No lower Center now then Swedens grave. 
O could not all thy purchas'd victories 
Like to thy Fame thy Flesh immortalize? 
Were not thy vertue nor thy valour charmes 
To guard thy body from those outward harmes 
Which could not reach thy soul? could not thy spirit 
Lend somewhat which thy frailty might inherit 
From thy diviner part, that Death nor Hate 
Nor envy's bullets ere could penetrate? 
Could not thy early Trophies in stern fight 
Torn from the Dane, the Pole, the Moscovite? 
Which were thy triumphs seeds, as pledges sown, 
That when thy honours harvest was ripe grown, 
With full-summ'd wing thou Falcon-like wouldst fly 
And cuff the Eagle in the German sky: 
Forcing his iron beak and feathers feel 
They were not proof 'gainst thy victorious steel. 
Could not all these protect thee? or prevaile 
To fright that Coward Death, who oft grew pale 
To look thee and thy battails in the face? 
Alas they could not: Destiny gives place 
To none; nor is it seen that Princes lives 
Can saved be by their prerogatives. 
No more was thine; who clos'd in thy cold lead, 
Dost from thy self a mournful lecture read 
Of Mans short-dated glory: learn you Kings, 
You are like him but penetrable things; 
Though you from Demi-Gods derive your birth, 
You are at best but honourable earth: 
And howere sifted from that courser bran 
Which does compound and knead the common man, 
Nothing's immortal or from earth refin'd 
About you, but your Office and your Mind. 
Here then break your false Glasses, which present 
You greater then your Maker ever meant: 
Make truth your Mirrour now, since you find all 
That flatter you confuted by his fall. 
Yet since it was decreed thy lifes bright Sun 
Must be eclips'd ere thy full course was run, 
Be proud thou didst in thy black Obsequies 
With greater glory set then others rise. 
For in thy death, as life, thou heldest one 
Most just and regular proportion. 
Look how the Circles drawn by Compass meet 
Indivisibly joyned head to feet, 
And by continued points which them unite 
Grow at once Circular and Infinite: 
So did thy Fate and honour now contend 
To match thy brave beginning with thy end. 
Therefore thou hadst instead of Passing bells 
The Drums and Cannons thunder for thy knells; 
And in the Field thou did'st triumphing dy, 
Closing thy eye-lids with a victory: 
That so by thousands who there lost their breath 
King-like thou might'st be waited on in death. 
Liv'd Plutarch now, and would of Cæsar tell, 
He could make none but Thee his parallel; 
Whose tide of glory swelling to the brim 
Needs borrow no addition from Him. 
When did great Julius in any Clime 
Atchieve so much and in so small a time? 
Or if he did, yet shalt Thou in that land 
Single for him and unexampled stand. 
When ore the Germans first his Eagle towr'd 
What saw the Legions which on them he pour'd? 
But massie bodies, made their swords to try 
Subjects not for his fight, but slavery. 
In that so vast expanded peece of ground 
(Now Swedens Theater and Tom he found 
Nothing worth Cæsars valour, or his fear, 
No conqu'ring Army, nor a Tilley there, 
Whose strength nor wiles, nor practice in the warre 
Might the fierce Torrent of thy triumphs barre, 
But that thy winged sword twice made him yield, 
Both from his trenches beat, and from the field. 
Besides the Romane thought he had done much 
Did he the bank of Rhenus onely touch. 
But though his march was bounded by the Rhine 
Not Oder nor the Danube Thee confine; 
And but thy frailty did thy fame prevent, 
Thou hadst thy conquests strecht to such extent, 
Thou might'st Vienna reach, and after span 
From Mulda to the Baltick Ocean. 
But death hath spann'd thee: nor must we divine 
What heir thou leav'st to finish thy design, 
Or who shall thee succeed as Champion 
For liberty and for religion. 
Thy task is done; as in a Watch the spring 
Wound to the height, relaxes with the string: 
So thy steel nerves of conquest, from their steep 
Ascent declin'd, lie slackt in thy last sleep. 
Rest then triumphant soul! for ever rest! 
And, like the Phœnix in her spicy nest, 
Embalm'd with thine own merit, upward fly, 
Born in a cloud of perfume to the sky. 
Whil'st, as in deathless Urnes, each noble mind 
Treasures thy ashes which are left behind. 
And if perhaps no Cassiopeian spark 
(Which in the North did thy first rising mark) 
Shine ore thy Herse: the breath of our just praise 
Shall to the Firmament thy vertues raise; 
Then fix, and kindle them into a Starre, 
Whose influence may crown thy glorious warre.

79,Vignesh Ravishankar Shanmugam,Elegy For My Soul,"Deep down me, 
Recedes a voice, 
Gone with it's poise, 
An echo of a knight, 
A relentless warrior, 
Fought peacfully on his will's behalf, 
Thought gregariously to mend the world, 
Feigned by the beauty, 
Torn by the harsh reality, 
Lost his eccentricity.

Oh! there recedes the voice, 
Voice of the dumb, 
Left with it's flesh and bone, 
Borne to mourn, 
Tears alone to drown the soul, 
Receded the voice, 
Dumped me heartless, painless, 
To face the crooked world.",Elegy
80,William Cowper,Elegy Vii. Anno Aetates Undevigesimo (Tr..,"As yet a stranger to the gentle fires
That Amathusia's smiling Queen inspires,
Not seldom I derided Cupid's darts,
And scorn'd his claim to rule all human hearts.
Go, child, I said, transfix the tim'rous dove,
An easy conquest suits an infant Love;
Enslave the sparrow, for such prize shall be
Sufficient triumph to a Chief like thee;
Why aim thy idle arms at human kind?
Thy shafts prevail not 'gainst the noble mind.
The Cyprian heard, and, kindling into ire,
(None kindles sooner) burn'd with double fire.
It was the Spring, and newly risen day
Peep'd o'er the hamlets on the First of May;
My eyes too tender for the blaze of light,
Still sought the shelter of retiring night,
When Love approach'd, in painted plumes arrayed;
Th'insidious god his rattling darts betray'd,
Nor less his infant features, and the sly
Sweet intimations of his threat'ning eye.
Such the Sigeian boy is seen above,
Filling the goblet for imperial Jove;
Such he, on whom the nymphs bestow'd their charms,
Hylas, who perish'd in a Naiad's arms.
Angry he seem'd, yet graceful in his ire,
And added threats, not destitute of fire.
'My power,' he said, 'by others pain alone,
'Twere best to learn; now learn it by thy own!
With those, who feel my power, that pow'r attest!
And in thy anguish be my sway confest! 
I vanquish'd Phoebus, though returning vain
From his new triumph o'er the Python slain,
And, when he thinks on Daphne, even He
Will yield the prize of archery to me.
A dart less true the Parthian horseman sped,
Behind him kill'd, and conquer'd as he fled,
Less true th'expert Cydonian, and less true
The youth, whose shaft his latent Procris slew.
Vanquish'd by me see huge Orion bend,
By me Alcides, and Alcides's friend.
At me should Jove himself a bolt design,
His bosom first should bleed transfix'd by mine.
But all thy doubts this shaft will best explain,
Nor shall it teach thee with a trivial pain,
Thy Muse, vain youth! shall not thy peace ensure,
Nor Phoebus' serpent yield thy wound a cure.
He spoke, and, waving a bright shaft in air,
Sought the warm bosom of the Cyprian fair.
That thus a child should bluster in my ear
Provok'd my laughter more than mov'd my fear.
I shun'd not, therefore, public haunts, but stray'd
Careless in city, or suburban shade,
And passing and repassing nymphs that mov'd
With grace divine, beheld where'er I rov'd.
Bright shone the vernal day, with double blaze,
As beauty gave new force to Phoebus' rays.
By no grave scruples check'd I freely eyed
The dang'rous show, rash youth my only guide,
And many a look of many a Fair unknown
Met full, unable to control my own. 
But one I mark'd (then peace forsook my breast)
One--Oh how far superior to the rest!
What lovely features! Such the Cyprian Queen
Herself might wish, and Juno wish her mien.
The very nymph was she, whom when I dar'd
His arrows, Love had even then prepar'd.
Nor was himself remote, nor unsupplied
With torch well-trimm'd and quiver at his side;
Now to her lips he clung, her eye-lids now,
Then settled on her cheeks or on her brow.
And with a thousand wounds from ev'ry part
Pierced and transpierced my undefended heart.
A fever, new to me, of fierce desire
Now seiz'd my soul, and I was all on fire,
But she, the while, whom only I adore,
Was gone, and vanish'd to appear no more.
In silent sadness I pursue my way,
I pause, I turn, proceed, yet wish to stay,
And while I follow her in thought, bemoan
With tears my soul's delight so quickly flown.
When Jove had hurl'd him to the Lemnian coast
So Vulcan sorrow'd for Olympus lost,
And so Oeclides, sinking into night,
From the deep gulph look'd up to distant light.
Wretch that I am, what hopes for me remain
Who cannot cease to love, yet love in vain?
Oh could I once, once more, behold the Fair,
Speak to her, tell her of the pangs I bear,
Perhaps she is not adamant, would show
Perhaps some pity at my tale of woe. 
Oh inauspicious flame--'tis mine to prove
A matchless instance of disastrous love.
Ah spare me, gentle Pow'r!--If such thou be
Let not thy deeds, and nature disagree.
Now I revere thy fires, thy bow, thy darts:
Now own thee sov'reign of all human hearts.
Spare me, and I will worship at no shrine
With vow and sacrifice, save only thine.
Remove! no--grant me still this raging woe!
Sweet is the wretchedness, that lovers know:
But pierce hereafter (should I chance to see
One destined mine) at once both her and me.

Such were the trophies, that in earlier days,
By vanity seduced I toil'd to raise,
Studious yet indolent, and urg'd by youth,
That worst of teachers, from the ways of Truth;
Till learning taught me, in his shady bow'r,
To quit love's servile yoke, and spurn his pow'r.
Then, on a sudden, the fierce flame supprest,
A frost continual settled on my breast, 
Whence Cupid fears his flames extinct to see,
And Venus dreads a Diomede15 in me.",Elegy
81,Mary Darby Robinson,"Elegy To The Memory Of David Garrick, Esq.","DEAR SHADE OF HIM, who grac'd the mimick scene,
And charm'd attention with resistless pow'r;
Whose wond'rous art, whose fascinating mien,
Gave glowing rapture to the short-liv'd hour! 

Accept the mournful verse, the ling'ring sigh,
The tear that faithful Mem'ry stays to shed;
The SACRED TEAR, that from Reflection's eye,
Drops on the ashes of the sainted dead. 

Lov'd by the grave, and courted by the young,
In social comforts eminently blest;
All hearts rever'd the precepts of thy tongue,
And Envy's self thy eloquence confess'd. 

Who could like thee the soul's wild tumults paint,
Or wake the torpid ear with lenient art?
Touch the nice sense with pity's dulcet plaint,
Or soothe the sorrows of the breaking heart? 

Who can forget thy penetrating eye, 
The sweet bewitching smile, th' empassion'd look?
The clear deep whisper, the persuasive sigh,
The feeling tear that Nature's language spoke? 

Rich in each treasure bounteous Heaven could lend,
For private worth distinguish'd and approv'd,
The pride of WISDOM,­VIRTUE's darling friend,
By MANSFIELD honor'd­and by CAMDEN lov'd! 

The courtier's cringe, the flatt'rer's abject smile,
The subtle arts of well-dissembled praise,
Thy soul abhorr'd;­above the gloss of guile,
Truth lead thy steps, and Friendship crown'd thy days. 

Oft in thy HAMPTON's dark embow'ring shade
The POET's hand shall sweep the trembling string;
While the proud tribute §to thy mem'ry paid,
The voice of GENIUS on the gale shall fling. 

Yes, SHERIDAN! thy soft melodious verse
Still vibrates on a nation's polish'd ear;
Fondly it hover'd o'er the sable hearse,
Hush'd the loud plaint, and triumph'd in a tear. 

In life united by congenial minds,
Dear to the MUSE, to sacred friendship true;
Around her darling's urn a wreath SHE binds,
A deathless wreath­immortaliz'd by YOU! 

But say, dear shade, is kindred mem'ry flown?
Has widow'd love at length forgot to weep?
That no kind verse, or monumental stone,
Marks the lone spot where thy cold relics sleep! 

Dear to a nation, grateful to thy muse,
That nation's tears upon thy grave shall flow,
For who the gentle tribute can refuse,
Which thy fine feeling gave to fancied woe? 

Thou who, by many an anxious toilsome hour,
Reap'd the bright harvest of luxuriant Fame,
Who snatch'd from dark oblivion's barb'rous pow'r
The radiant glories of a SHAKSPERE's name! 

Rembrance oft shall paint the mournful scene
Where the slow fun'ral spread its length'ning gloom,
Where the deep murmur, and dejected mien,
In artless sorrow linger'd round thy tomb. 

And tho' no laurel'd bust, or labour'd line,
Shall bid the passing stranger stay to weep;
Thy SHAKSPERE's hand shall point the hallow'd shrine,
And Britain's genius with thy ashes sleep.

Then rest in peace, O ever sacred shade!
Your kindred souls exulting FAME shall join;
And the same wreath thy hand for SHAKSPERE made,
Gemm'd with her tears about THY GRAVE SHALL TWINE.",Elegy
82,Thomas Parnell,"An Elegy, To An Old Beauty","In vain, poor Nymph, to please our youthful sight 
You sleep in cream and frontlets all the night, 
Your face with patches soil, with paint repair, 
Dress with gay gowns, and shade with foreign hair. 
If truth in spight of manners must be told, 
Why, really fifty-five is something old. 

Once you were young; or one, whose life's so long 
She might have born my mother, tells me wrong. 
And once (since Envy's dead before you die,) 
The women own, you play'd a sparkling eye, 
Taught the light foot a modish little trip, 
And pouted with the prettiest purple lip -- 

To some new charmer are the roses fled, 
Which blew, to damask all thy cheek with red; 
Youth calls the Graces there to fix their reign, 
And airs by thousands fill their easy train. 
So parting Summer bids her flow'ry prime 
Attend the sun to dress some foreign clime, 
While with'ring seasons in succession, here, 
Strip the gay gardens, and deform the year. 

But thou (since Nature bids) the world resign, 
'Tis now thy daughter's daughter's time to shine. 
With more address, (or such as pleases more) 
She runs her female exercises o'er, 
Unfurls or closes, raps or turns the Fan, 
And smiles, or blushes at the creature Man. 
With quicker life, as guilded coaches pass, 
In sideling courtesy she drops the glass. 

With better strength, on visit-days she bears 
To mount her fifty flights of ample stairs. 
Her mein, her shape, her temper, eyes and tongue 
Are sure to conquer. -- for the rogue is young; 
And all that's madly wild, or oddly gay, 
We call it only pretty Fanny's way. 

Let time that makes you homely, make you sage, 
The sphere of wisdom is the sphere of age. 
'Tis true, when beauty dawns with early fire, 
And hears the flatt'ring tongues of soft desire, 
If not from virtue, from its gravest ways 
The soul with pleasing avocation strays. 
But beauty gone, 'tis easier to be wise; 
As harper better, by the loss of eyes. 

Henceforth retire, reduce your roving airs, 
Haunt less the plays, and more the publick pray'rs, 
Reject the Mechlin Head, and gold brocade, 
Go pray, in sober Norwich Crape array'd. 
Thy pendent diamonds let thy Fanny take, 
(Their trembling lustre shows how much you shake;) 
Or bid her wear thy necklace row'd with pearl, 
You'll find your Fanny an obedient girl. 

So for the rest, with less incumbrance hung, 
You walk thro' life, unmingled with the young; 
And view the shade and substance as you pass 
With joint endeavour trifling at the glass, 
Or Folly drest, and rambling all her days, 
To meet her counterpart, and grow by praise: 
Yet still sedate your self, and gravely plain, 
You neither fret, nor envy at the vain. 

'Twas thus (if Man with Woman we compare) 
The wise Athenian crost a glittering fair, 
Unmov'd by tongues and sights, he walk'd the place, 
Thro' tape, toys, tinsel, gimp, perfume, and lace; 
Then bends from Mars's Hill his awful eyes, 
And ""What a world I never want?"" he cries; 
But cries unheard: For Folly will be free. 
So parts the buzzing gaudy crowd, and he: 
As careless he for them, as they for him; 
He wrapt in wisdom, and they whirl'd by whim.",Elegy
83,Henry King,An Elegy Upon S. W. R.,"I will not weep, for 'twere as great a sin

With whom thou tugg'st &amp; strov'st ev'n out of breath 
In thy long toil: nere master'd till thy death; 
And then despight of trains and cruell wit, 
Thou did'st at once subdue malice and it. 
I dare not then so blast thy memory

Were I to choose a subject to bestow

Who when they thought to make thee scandals story 
Lent thee a swifter flight to Heav'n and glory. 
That thought by cutting off some wither'd dayes, 
(Which thou could'st spare them) to eclipse thy praise; 
Yet gave it brighter foil, made thy ag'd fame 
Appear more white and fair, then foul their shame: 
And did promote an Execution 
Which (but for them) Nature and Age had done.

84,James Hogg,Elegy On The Death  Of A Child,"Fair was thy blossom, tender flower,
That open'd like the rose in May,
Though nursed beneath the chilly shower
Of fell regret, for love's decay.

How oft thy mother heaved the sigh
O'er wreaths of honour early shorn,
Before thy sweet and guiltless eye
Had open'd on the dawn of morn!

How oft, above thy lowly bed,
When all in silence slumber'd low,
The fond and filial tear was shed,
Thou child of love, of shame, and woe!

Her wrong'd but gentle bosom burn'd
With joy thy opening bloom to see;
The only breast that o'er thee yearn'd;
The only heart that cared for thee.

Oft her young eye, with tear-drops bright,
Pleaded with Heaven for her sweet child,
When faded dreams of past delight
O'er recollection wander'd wild.

Fair was thy blossom, bonnie flower,
Fair as the softest wreaths of spring,
When late I saw thee seek the bower
In peace thy morning hymn to sing.

Thy little foot across the lawn
Scarce from the primrose press'd the dew;
I thought the spirit of the dawn
Before me to the greenwood flew.

E'en then the shaft was on the wing,
Thy spotless soul from earth to sever,
A tear of pity wet the string
That twang'd, and seal'd thy doom for ever.

I saw thee late, the emblem fair
Of beauty, innocence, and truth,
Start tiptoe on the verge of air, 
'Twixt childhood and unstable youth;

But now I see thee stretch'd at rest:
To break that rest shall wake no morrow - 
Pale as the grave-flower on thy breast!
Poor child of love, of shame, and sorrow!

May thy long sleep be sound and sweet;
Thy visions fraught with bliss to be;
And long the daisy, emblem meet,
Shall shed its earliest tear o'er thee!",Elegy
85,William Cowper,Elegy I. To Charles Deodati (Translated ..,"At length, my friend, the far-sent letters come,
Charged with thy kindness, to their destin'd home,
They come, at length, from Deva's Western side,
Where prone she seeks the salt Vergivian tide.
Trust me, my joy is great that thou shouldst be,
Though born of foreign race, yet born for me,
And that my sprightly friend, now free to roam,
Must seek again so soon his wonted home.
I well content, where Thames with refluent tide
My native city laves, meantime reside,
Nor zeal nor duty, now, my steps impell
To reedy Cam, and my forbidden cell.
Nor aught of pleasure in those fields have I,
That, to the musing bard, all shade deny.
'Tis time, that I, a pedant's threats disdain,
And fly from wrongs, my soul will ne'er sustain.
If peaceful days, in letter'd leisure spent
Beneath my father's roof, be banishment,
Then call me banish'd, I will ne'er refuse
A name expressive of the lot I chuse. 
I would that exiled to the Pontic shore,
Rome's hapless bard had suffer'd nothing more!
He then had equall'd even Homer's lays,
And, Virgil! thou hadst won but second praise.
For here I woo the Muse with no control,
And here my books--my life--absorb me whole.
Here too I visit, or to smile, or weep,
The winding theatre's majestic sweep;
The grave or gay colloquial scene recruits
My spirits spent in Learning's long pursuits. 
Whether some Senior shrewd, or spendthrift heir,
Wooer, or soldier, now unarm'd, be there,
Or some coif'd brooder o'er a ten years' cause
Thunder the Norman gibb'rish of the laws.
The lacquey, there, oft dupes the wary sire,
And, artful, speeds th'enamour'd son's desire.
There, virgins oft, unconscious what they prove,
What love is, know not, yet, unknowing, love.
Or, if impassion'd Tragedy wield high
The bloody sceptre, give her locks to fly 
Wild as the winds, and roll her haggard eye,
I gaze, and grieve, still cherishing my grief.
At times, e'en bitter tears! yield sweet relief.
As when from bliss untasted torn away,
Some youth dies, hapless, on his bridal day,
Or when the ghost, sent back from shades below,
Fills the assassin's heart with vengeful woe,
When Troy, or Argos, the dire scene affords,
Or Creon's hall laments its guilty lords.
Nor always city-pent or pent at home 
I dwell, but when Spring calls me forth to roam
Expatiate in our proud suburban shades
Of branching elm that never sun pervades.
Here many a virgin troop I may descry,
Like stars of mildest influence, gliding by,
Oh forms divine! Oh looks that might inspire
E'en Jove himself, grown old, with young desire!
Oft have I gazed on gem-surpassing eyes,
Outsparkling every star that gilds the skies.
Necks whiter than the iv'ry arm bestow'd 
By Jove on Pelops, or the Milky Road!
Bright locks, Love's golden snares, these falling low,
Those playing wanton o'er the graceful brow!
Cheeks too, more winning sweet than after show'r,
Adonis turn'd to Flora's fav'rite flow'r!
Yield, Heroines, yield, and ye who shar'd th'embrace
Of Jupiter in ancient times, give place;
Give place ye turban'd Fair of Persia's coast,
And ye, not less renown'd, Assyria's boast!
Submit, ye nymphs of Greece! Ye once the bloom 
Of Ilion, and all ye of haughty Rome,
Who swept of old her theatres with trains
Redundant, and still live in classic strains!
To British damsels beauty's palm is due,
Aliens! to follow them is fame for you.
Oh city, founded by Dardanian hands,
Whose towering front the circling realm commands,
Too blest abode! no loveliness we see
In all the earth, but it abounds in thee.
The virgin multitude that daily meets,
Radiant with gold and beauty, in thy streets,
Outnumbers all her train of starry fires
With which Diana gilds thy lofty spires.
Fame says, that wafted hither by her doves,
With all her host of quiver-bearing Loves,
Venus, prefering Paphian scenes no more,
Has fix'd her empire on thy nobler shore.
But lest the sightless boy inforce my stay,
I leave these happy walls, while yet I may.
Immortal Moly shall secure my heart
From all the sorc'ry of Circaean art,
And I will e'en repass Cam's reedy pools
To face once more the warfare of the Schools.
Meantime accept this trifle; Rhymes, though few,
Yet such as prove thy friend's remembrance true.",Elegy

A youth to flats and flatties not unknown.
The Plymouth Brethren gave it to him hot;
Trinity, Cambridge, claimed him for her own.

At chess a minor master, Hoylake set
His handicap a 2. Love drove him crazy;
Thrre thousand women used to call him “pet”;
In other gardens daffodil or daisy?

He climbed a lot of mountains in his time.
He stalked the tiger, bear and elephant.
he wrote a stack of poems, some sublime

87,James Beattie,Elegy (Tir'D With The Busy Crouds),"Tir'd with the busy crouds, that all the day 
Impatient throng where Folly's altars flame, 
My languid powers dissolve with quick decay, 
Till genial Sleep repair the sinking frame. 

Hail kind Reviver! that canst lull the cares, 
And every weary sense compose to rest, 
Lighten th' oppressive load which Anguish bears, 
And warm with hope the cold desponding breast. 

Touch'd by thy rod, from Power's majestic brow 
Drops the gay plume; he pines a lowly clown; 
And on the cold earth stretch'd the son of Woe 
Quaffs Pleasure's draught, and wears a fancy'd crown. 

When rous'd by thee, on boundless pinions born 
Fancy to fairy scenes exults to rove, 
Now scales the cliff gay-gleaming on the morn, 
Now sad and silent treads the deepening grove; 

Or skims the main, and listens to the storms, 
Marks the long waves roll far remote away; 
Or mingling with ten thousand glittering forms 
Floats on the gale, and basks in purest day. 

Haply, ere long, pierc'd by the howling blast 
Through dark and pathless desarts I shall roam, 
Plunge down th' unfathom'd deep, or shrink aghast 
Where bursts the shrieking spectre from the tomb: 

Perhaps loose Luxury's enchanting smile 
Shall lure my steps to some romantic dale, 
Where Mirth's light freaks th' unheeded hours beguile, 
And airs of rapture warble in the gale. 

Instructive emblem of this mortal state! 
Where scenes as various every hour arise 
In swift succession, which the hand of Fate 
Presents, then snatches from our wondering eyes. 

Be taught, vain man, how fleeting all thy joys, 
Thy boasted grandeur, and thy glittering store; 
Death comes, and all thy fancy'd bliss destroys, 
Quick as a dream it fades, and is no more. 

And, sons of Sorrow! though the threatening storm 
Of angry Fortune overhang a while, 
Let not her frowns your inward peace deform; 
Soon happier days in happier climes shall smile. 

Through earth's throng'd visions while we toss forlorn, 
'Tis tumult all, and rage, and restless strife; 
But these shall vanish like the dreams of morn, 
When Death awakes us to immortal life.",Elegy

89,Thomas Chatterton,Elegy On The Death Of Mr. Phillips,"No more I hail the morning's golden gleam,
No more the wonders of the view I sing;
Friendship requires a melancholy theme,
At her command the awful lyre I string!

Now as I wander through this leafless grove,
Where tempests howl, and blasts eternal rise,
How shall I teach the chorded shell to move,
Or stay the gushing torrent from my eyes?

Phillips! great master of the boundless lyre,
The would my soul-rack'd muse attempt to paint;
Give me a double portion of thy fire,
Or all the powers of language are too faint.

Say, soul unsullied by the filth of vice,
Say, meek-eyed spirit, where's thy tuneful shell,
Which when the silver stream was lock'd with ice,
Was wont to cheer the tempest-ravaged dell?

Oft as the filmy veil of evening drew
The thick'ning shade upon the vivid green,
Thou, lost in transport at the dying view,
Bid'st the ascending muse display the scene.

When golden Autumn, wreathed in ripen'd corn,
From purple clusters prest the foamy wine,
Thy genius did his sallow brows adorn,
And made the beauties of the season thine.

With rustling sound the yellow foliage flies,
And wantons with the wind in rapid whirls;
The gurgling riv'let to the valley hies,
Whilst on its bank the spangled serpent curls.

The joyous charms of Spring delighted saw
Their beauties doubly glaring in thy lay;
Nothing was Spring which Phillips did not draw,
And every image of his muse was May.

So rose the regal hyacinthial star,
So shone the verdure of the daisied bed,
So seemed the forest glimmering from afar;
You saw the real prospect as you read.

Majestic Summer's blooming flow'ry pride
Next claim'd the honour of his nervous song;
He taught the stream in hollow trills to glide,
And led the glories of the year along.

Pale rugged Winter bending o'er his tread,
His grizzled hair bedropt with icy dew;
His eyes, a dusky light congealed and dead,
His robe, a tinge of bright ethereal blue.

His train a motley'd, sanguine, sable cloud,
He limps along the russet, dreary moor,
Whilst rising whirlwinds, blasting, keen, and loud,
Roll the white surges to the sounding shore.

Nor were his pleasures unimproved by thee;
Pleasures he has, though horridly deform'd;
The polished lake, the silver'd hill we see,
Is by thy genius fired, preserved, and warm'd.

The rough October has his pleasures too;
But I'm insensible to every joy:
Farewell the laurel! now I grasp the yew,
And all my little powers in grief employ.

Immortal shadow of my much-loved friend!
Clothed in thy native virtue meet my soul,
When on the fatal bed, my passions bend,
And curb my floods of anguish as they roll.

In thee each virtue found a pleasing cell,
Thy mind was honour, thy soul divine;
With thee did every god of genius dwell,
Thou was the Helicon of all the nine.

Fancy, whose various figure-tinctured vest
Was ever changing to a different hue;
Her head, with varied bays and flow'rets drest,
Her eyes, two spangles of the morning dew.

With dancing attitude she swept thy string;
And now she soars, and now again descends;
And now reclining on the zephyr's wing,
Unto the velvet-vested mead she bends.

Peace, deck'd in all the softness of the dove,
Over thy passions spread her silver plume;
The rosy veil of harmony and love
Hung on thy soul in eternal bloom.

Peace, gentlest, softest of the virtues, spread
Her silver pinions, wet with dewy tears,
Upon her best distinguished poet's head,
And taught his lyre the music of the spheres.

Temp'rance, with health and beauty in her train,
And massy-muscled strength in graceful pride,
Pointed at scarlet luxury and pain,
And did at every frugal feast preside.

Black melancholy stealing to the shade
With raging madness, frantic, loud, and dire,
Whose bloody hand displays the reeking blade,
Were strangers to thy heaven-directed lyre.

Content, who smiles in every frown of fate,
Wreath'd thy pacific brow and sooth'd thy ill:
In thy own virtues and thy genius great,
The happy muse laid every trouble still.

But see! the sick'ning lamp of day retires,
And the meek evening shakes the dusky grey;
The west faint glimmers with the saffron fires,
And like thy life, O Phillips! dies away.

Here, stretched upon this heaven-ascending hill,
I'll wait the horrors of the coming night,
I'll imitate the gently-plaintive rill,
And by the glare of lambent vapours write.

Wet with the dew the yellow hawthorns bow;
The rustic whistles through the echoing cave;
Far o'er the lea the breathing cattle low,
And the full Avon lifts the darken'd wave.

Now, as the mantle of the evening swells
Upon my mind, I feel a thick'ning gloom!
Ah! could I charm by necromantic spells
The soul of Phillips from the deathy tomb!

Then would we wander through the darken'd vale,
In converse such as heavenly spirits use,
And, borne upon the pinions of the gale,
Hymn the Creator, and exert the muse.

But, horror to reflection! now no more
Will Phillips sing, the wonder of the plain!
When, doubting whether they might not adore,
Admiring mortals heard his nervous strain.

See! see! the pitchy vapour hides the lawn,
Nought but a doleful bell of death is heard,
Save where into a blasted oak withdrawn
The scream proclaims the curst nocturnal bird.

Now, rest my muse, but only rest to weep
A friend made dear by every sacred tie;
Unknown to me be comfort peace or sleep:
Phillips is dead- 'tis pleasure then to die.

Few are the pleasures Chatterton e'er knew,
Short were the moments of his transient peace;
But melancholy robb'd him of those few,
And this hath bid all future comfort cease.

And can the muse be silent, Phillips gone!
And am I still alive? My soul, arise!
The robe of immortality put on,
And meet thy Phillips in his native skies.",Elegy

92,chandra thiagarajan,Taj Mahal- -An Elegy In Marble,"Taj Mahal, the glory, of India
Is an epic marble monument
Situated in Uttar Pradesh, Agra
Which  is immensely magnificent.

It majestically, with dignity,  stands
On the banks of river Yamuna- 
Where many a tourist happily lands
To  view the spectacle and the panorama.

Shah Jahan the Mughal Emperor built
In memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal
The Paradise on Earth that would never wilt
A   monument of enormous beauty-  the Taj Mahal.! 

In the year 1631, the Queen passed away
And the Emperor was inconsolable- 
In his misery, none could him allay.
His mission now, was to erect a monument admirable.

His deep love for her being intangible
He wished to build a sepulchre in her memory
 The monument, he thought, ought to be incredible
With  a never before thought of finery.

For money the Emperor had no dearth
He spent more than thirty two crores
In those days it was many times its worth
With all his amassed resources.

Over 42 acres of land, the monument occupied
The central focus of the complex being the tomb
Four tall minarets frame on every side
A spectacular marble dome surrounds the tomb.

Islamic, Indian, Ottoman, Turkish, and Persian
Are the architectural style- - elements
The principal designer Lahauri’s combinations
Is an integrated complex of structures’ placements.

Twenty two long years it took
Employing workers twenty thousand
To fetch the phenomenal beauteous look
 With  over thousand elephants summoned.

To transport the required material
From the whole of India
For the construction ideal
With  sculptors from Persia.

The translucent white marble
Was brought from Makrana and Rajasthan
From China came Jade and Crystal
The Lapis Lazuli was from Afghanisthan.

The turquoise was from Tibet
Sapphire was got from Sri Lanka
For the special carving of the rosette
Carnelian was got from Arabia.

Calligraphers came from Syria
From Bukhara too came sculptors
The In-layers came from South India
And from Baluchisthan came stone-cutters.

Taj Mahal is a marble mausoleum in white
Jeweled in stones semi-precious
It is an unimaginable delight
To  eye the paradise on earth for the empress.

The main monument is two storeyed
With a huge rotunda over the octagonal building 
The celebrated duo are there buried
Where sky-scrapper minarets are shielding. 

The top with a lotus design is decorated
Which  serves to accentuate the height
The finial by a crescent moon is spotted
A  typical Islamic motif –which is a lovely sight.

 To the complex of Taj Mahal portal
Are three beautiful  gate-ways –lofty
Richly decorated is the portion- central
With delicate carvings in marble—a beauty.

Dazzling precious stones, inlaid, adorn
In floral and geometric illustrations
Inscription with passages from Quran
Display the Islamic faith—compositions.

Taj Mahal means Crown Palace
The  visual grandeur with no equal
Gave the Emperor much solace
For  the rich beauty had no rival.

The Taj is beauty personified
Bringing a saga come alive
It stands with its blissful pride
As one and only of its kind that does survive.

It is considered as an architectural wonder
Which  is beyond the scope of words
In the full moon light the splendor
Of the combination of solids and voids

Concave and convex and light shadow
Of the arches and domes are all aesthetic.
In the early morn it is aglow
And the visual treat is ecstatic.

The Taj,  different shades displays
It is pinkish in the morning
With the moon it shines with golden rays
 And is milky white in the evening.

Taj Mahal is greatly remarkable
For its perfect geometric proportions
And for the marvel of marvels in marble
As  also for its architectural decorations.

 The Taj Mahal has been classified- - right
As a new  “ Wonder of the World” for its charm
It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site
To  take good care lest it comes to harm.

 It is the ethereal love for his wife Mumtaz Mahal
That  induced the King to build the Taj for her glory
Rabindranath Tagore described the Taj Mahal
As- “It’s a tear drop on the cheek of history”.

Taj Mahal was the ultimate realization
As a symbol of pure love and emotion
Of Emperor Shah Jahan’s dream of immortalization
Of  the divinity of his eternal love and passion.",Elegy

To a Friend


For rural virtues, and for native skies,
I bade Augusta's venal sons farewell;
Now 'mid the trees I see my smoke arise,
Now hear the fountains bubbling round my cell.

O may that Genius, which secures my rest,
Preserve this villa for a friend that's dear!
Ne'er may my vintage glad the sordid breast,
Ne'er tinge the lip that dares be insincere!

Far from these paths, ye faithless Friends, depart!
Fly my plain board, abhor my hostile name!
Hence the faint verse that flows not from the heart,
But mourns, in labour'd strains, the price of fame!

O loved Simplicity! be thine the prize!
Assiduous Art correct her page in vain!
His be the palm, who, guiltless of disguise,
Contemns the power the dull resource to feign!

Still may the mourner, lavish of his tears
For lucre's venal need, invite my scorn!
Still may the bard, dissembling doubts and fears,
For praise, for flattery sighing, sigh forlorn!

Soft as the line of lovesick Hammond flows,
'Twas his fond heart effused the melting theme;
Ah! never could Aonia's hill disclose
So fair a fountain, or so loved a stream.

Ye loveless Bards! intent with artful pains
To form a sigh, or to contrive a tear!
Forego your Pindus, and on - plains
Survey Camilla's charms, and grow sincere.

But thou, my Friend! while in thy youthful soul
Love's gentle tyrant seats his awful throne,
Write from thy bosom-let not art control
The ready pen, that makes his edicts known.

Pleasing, when youth is long expired, to trace
The forms our pencil or our pen design'd!
'Such was our youthful air, and shape, and face!
Such the soft image of our youthful mind!'

Soft, whilst we sleep beneath the rural bowers,
The Loves and Graces steal unseen away;
And where the turf diffused its pomp of flowers,
We wake to wintry scenes of chill decay!

Curse the sad fortune that detains thy fair;
Praise the soft hours that gave thee to her arms;
Paint thy proud scorn of every vulgar care,
When hope exalts thee, or when doubt alarms.

Where with Oenone thou hast worn the day,
Near fount or stream, in meditation, rove;
If in the grove Oenone loved to stray,
The faithful Muse shall meet thee in the grove.",Elegy

They have their waving pennons and their flagges, 
(Of Matches and Alliance formal bragges.) 
VVhen thou (although from Ancestors thou came 
Old as the Heptarchy, great as thy Name) 
Sleep'st there inshrin'd in thy admired parts, 
And hast no Heraldry but thy deserts. 
Yet let not Them their prouder Marbles boast, 
For They rest with less honour, though more cost. 
Go, search the world, and with your Mattocks wound 
The groaning bosom of the patient ground: 
Digge from the hidden veins of her dark womb 
All that is rare and precious for a tomb: 
Yet when much treasure, and more time is spent 
You must grant His the nobler Monument. 
Whose Faith stands ore Him for a Hearse, and hath 
The Resurrection for His Epitaph.",Elegy
99,Henry King,An Elegy Upon The Most Incomparable K. C..,"Call for amazed thoughts, a wounded sense 
And bleeding Hearts at our Intelligence. 
Call for that Trump of Death the Mandrakes Groan 
Which kills the Hearers: This befits alone 
Our Story which through times vast Kalendar 
Must stand without Example or Repair. 
What spowts of melting Clowds what endless springs 
Powr'd in the Oceans lapp for offerings 
Shall feed the hungry torrent of our grief 
Too mighty for expression or belief? 
Though all those moistures which the brain attracts 
Ran from our eyes like gushing Cataracts, 
Or our sad accents could out-tongue the Cryes 
Which did from mournful Hadadrimmon rise 
Since that remembrance of Josiah slain 
In our King's murther is reviv'd again. 
O pardon me that but from Holy Writ 
Our losse allowes no Parallel to it: 
Nor call it bold presumption that I dare 
Charles with the best of Judah's Kings compare: 
The vertues of whose life did I prefer 
The Text acquits me for no Flatterer. 
For He like David perfect in his trust, 
Was never stayn'd like Him, with Blood or Lust. 
One who with Solomon in Judgement try'd, 
Was quick to comprehend, Wise to decide, 
(That even his Judges stood amaz'd to hear 
A more transcendent Moover in their Sphear) 
Though more Religious: for when doting Love 
A while made Solomon Apostate proove 
Charles nev'r endur'd the Truth which he profest 
To be unfixt by Bosome interest. 
Bold as Jehosaphat, yet forc'd to Fight, 
And for his own, no unconcerned Right. 
Should I recount His constant time of Pray'r 
Each rising Morn and Ev'ning Regular 
You'ld say his practice preach'd They ought not Eat 
Who by devotion first not earn'd their Meat. 
Thus Hezekiah He exceeds in Zeal, 
Though not (like him) So facile to reveal 
The Treasures of Gods House, or His own Heart 
To be supplanted by some forcin art. 
And that he might in fame with Joash share 
When he the ruin'd Temple did repair, 
His cost on Paules late ragged Fabrick spent 
Must (if no other) be His Monument. 
From this Survey the Kingdom may conclude 
His Merits, and her Losses Magnitude. 
Nor think he flatters or blasphemes, who tells 
That Charls exceeds Judea's Parallels, 
In whom all Vertues we concentred see
Which 'mongst the best of them divided be. 
O weak built Glories! which those Tempests feel 
To force you from your firmest bases reel, 
What from the stroaks of Chance shall you secure, 
When Rocks of Innocence are so unsure? 
When the World's only mirror slaughter'd lies, 
Envies and Treasons bleeding sacrifize? 
As if His stock of Goodnesse could become 
No Kalendar, but that of Martyrdom. 
See now ye cursed Mountebanks of State, 
Who have Eight years for Reformation sate; 
You who dire Alva's Counsels did transfer
To Act his Scenes on England's Theater; 
You who did pawn your Selves in Publick Faith 
To slave the Kingdome by your Pride and Wrath; 
Call the whole World to witnesse now, how just, 
How well you are responsive to your trust, 
How to your King the promise you perform, 
With Fasts, and Sermons, and long Prayers sworn, 
That you intended Peace and Truth to bring 
To make your Charls Europes most Glorious King. 
Did you for this Lift up your Hands on high, 
To Kill the King, and pluck down Monarchy? 
These are the Fruits by your vvild Faction sown, 
Which not Imputed are, but Born your own. 
For though you wisely seem to wash your Hands, 
The Guilt on every Vote and Order stands. 
So that convinc'd from all you did before, 
Justice must lay the Murther at your Door. 
Mark if the Body does not Bleed anew, 
In any Circumstance approach'd by You, 
From whose each motion we might plain descry 
The black Ostents of this late Tragedy. 
For when the King through Storms in Scotland bred 
To his Great Councel for his shelter fled, 
When in that meeting every Error gain'd 
Redresses sooner granted, than Complain'd: 
Not all those frank Concessions or Amends 
Did suit the then too Powerfull Faction's ends, 
No Acts of Grace at present would Content, 
Nor Promise of Triennial Parl'ament, 
Till by a formal Law the King had past 
This Session should at Your pleasure last. 
So having got the Bitt, and that 'twas known 
No power could dissolve You but Your own, 
Your gracelesse Junto make such use of this, 
As once was practis'd by Semiramis; 
Who striving by a subtile Sute to prove 
The largenesse of her Husbands Trust and Love, 
Did from the much abused King obtain 
That for three dayes She might sole Empresse reign: 
Before which time expir'd, the bloody Wife 
Depriv'd her Lord both of his Crown and Life. 
There needs no Comment when your deeds apply 
The Demonstration of her Treachery. 
Which to effect by Absolon's foul wile 
You of the Peoples Heart your Prince beguile; 
Urging what Eases they might reap by it 
Did you their Legislative Judges sit. 
How did you fawn upon, and Court the Rout, 
Whose Clamour carry'd your whole Plot about? 
How did you thank Seditious men that came 
To bring Petitions which your selves did frame? 
And lest they wanted Hands to set them on, 
You lead the way by throwing the first stone. 
For in that Libel after Midnight born, 
Wherewith your Faction labour'd till the Morn, 
That famous Lye, you a Remonstrance name;
Were not Reproaches your malitious aim? 
Was not the King's dishonour your intent 
By Slanders to traduce his Government? 
All which your spightful Cunning did contrive 
Men must receive through your false Perspective, 
In which the smallest Spots improved were, 
And every Mote a Mountain did appear. 
Thus Cæsar by th'ungrateful Senate found 
His Life assaulted through his Honor's Wound. 
And now to make Him hopelesse to resist, 
You guide His Sword by Vote, which as you list 
Must Strike or Spare (for so you did enforce 
His Hand against His Reason to divorce 
Brave Strafford's Life) then wring it quite away 
By your usurping Each Militia:
Then seize His Magazines, of which possest 
You turn the Weapons 'gainst their Master's Breast. 
This done, th'unkennell'd crew of Lawless men 
Led down by Watkins, Pennington, and Ven, 
Did with confused noise the Court invade; 
Then all Dissenters in Both Houses Bay'd. 
At which the King amaz'd is forc'd to flye, 
The whilst your Mouth's laid on maintain the Cry. 
The Royal Game dislodg'd and under Chase, 
Your hot Pursute dogs Him from place to place: 
Not Saul with greater fury or disdain 
Did flying David from Jeshimon's plain 
Unto the barren Wildernesse pursue, 
Than Cours'd and Hunted is the King by you. 
The Mountain Partridge or the Chased Roe 
Might now for Emblemes of His Fortune go. 
And since all other May-games of the Town 
(Save those your selves should make) were Voted down, 
The Clam'rous Pu'pit Hollaes in resort, 
Inviting men to your King-catching Sport. 
Where as the Foyl grows cold you mend the Sent 
By crying Privilege of Parliament, 
Whose fair Pretensions the first sparkles are, 
Which by your breath blown up enflame the War, 
And Ireland (bleeding by design) the Stale 
Wherewith for Men and Mony you prevail. 
Yet doubting that Imposture could not last, 
When all the Kingdoms Mines of Treasure waste, 
You now tear down Religion's sacred Hedge 
To carry on the Work by Sacriledge; 
Reputing it Rebellions fittest Pay 
To take both God's and Cesar's dues away. 
The tenor of which execrable Vote 
Your over-active Zelots so promote, 
That neither Tomb nor Temple could escape, 
Nor Dead nor Living your Licentious Rape. 
Statues and Grave-stones o're men buried 
Rob'd of their Brass, the Coffins of their Led; 
Not the Seventh Henry's gilt and curious Skreen, 
Nor those which 'mongst our Rarities were seen, 
The Chests wherein the Saxon Monarchs lay, 
But must be basely sold or thrown away. 
May in succeeding times forgotten be 
Those bold Examples of Impiety, 
Which were the Ages wonder and discourse, 
You have Their greatest ills improv'd by worse. 
No more be mention'd Dionysius Theft,
Who of their Gold the Heathen Shrines bereft; 
For who with Yours His Robberies confer, 
Must him repute a petty Pilferer. 
Nor Julian's Scoff, who when he view'd the State 
Of Antioch's Church, the Ornaments and Plate, 
Cry'd, Meaner Vessels would serve turn, or None 
Might well become the birth of Mary's Sonn 
Nor how that spightfull Atheist did in scorn
Pisse on God's Table, which so oft had born 
The hallow'd Elements his death present: 
Nor he that fould it with his Excrement,
Then turn'd the Cloth unto that act of shame, 
Which without trembling Christians should not name. 
Nor John of Leyden, who the pillag'd Quires 
Employ'd in Munster for his own attires; 
His pranks by Hazlerig exceeded be, 
A wretch more wicked and as mad as he, 
Who once in triumph led his Sumpter Moil
Proudly bedecked with the Altar's spoil. 
Nor at Bizantium's sack how Mahomet 
In St. Sophia's Church his Horses set. 
Nor how Belshazzar at his drunken Feasts 
Carows'd in holy Vessels to his Guests: 
Nor he that did the Books and Anthems tear, 
Which in the daily Stations used were. 
These were poor Essayes of imperfect Crimes, 
Fit for beginners in unlearned times, 
Siz'd onely for that dull Meridian 
Which knew no Jesuit nor Puritan, 
(Before whose fatal Birth were no such things 
As Doctrines to Depose and Murther Kings.) 
But since Your prudent care Enacted well, 
That there should be no King in Israel, 
England must write such Annals of Your Reign 
Which all Records of elder mischiefs stain. 
Churches unbuilt by order, others burn'd; 
Whilst Pauls and Lincoln are to Stables turn'd; 
And at God's Table you might Horses see 
By (those more Beasts) their Riders manger'd be. 
Some Kitchins and some Slaughter-houses made, 
Communion-boards and Cloths for Dressers laid: 
Some turn'd to loathsome Gaols, so by you brought 
Unto the Curse of Baal's House, a Draught. 
The Common-Prayers with the Bibles torn, 
The Coaps in Antick Moorish-Dances worn, 
And sometimes for the wearers greater mock, 
The Surplice is converted to a Frock. 
Some bringing Dogs the Sacrament revile, 
Some with Copronimus the Font defile. 
O God! canst Thou these prophanations like? 
If not, why is thy Thunder slow to strike 
The cursed Authors? who dare think that Thou 
Dost, when not punish them, their acts allow. 
All which outragious Crimes, though your pretence 
Would fasten on the Soldiers insolence, 
We must believe that what by them was done 
Came licens'd forth by your probation. 
For, as your selves with Athaliah's Brood 
In strong contention for precedence stood, 
You robb'd Two Royall Chapels of their Plate,
Which Kings and Queens to God did dedicate; 
Then by a Vote more sordid than the Stealth, 
Melt down and Coin it for the Common-wealth; 
That is, give't up to the devouring jaws 
Of your great Idol Bell, new styl'd The Cause. 
And though this Monster you did well devise 
To feed by Plunder, Taxes, Loans, Excise; 
(All which Provisions You the People tell 
Scarce serve to diet Your Pantagruel.) 
We no strew'd Ashes need to trace the Cheat, 
Who plainly see what Mouthes the Messes eat. 
Brave Reformation! and a through one too, 
Which to enrich Your selves must All undo. 
Pray tell us (those that can) What fruits have grown 
From all Your Seeds in Blood and Treasure sown? 
What would you mend? when Your Projected State 
Doth from the Best in Form degenerate? 
Or why should You (of All) attempt the Cure, 
Whose Facts nor Gospels Test nor Laws endure? 
But like unwholsome Exhalations met 
From Your Conjunction onely Plagues beget, 
And in Your Circle, as Imposthumes fill 
Which by their venome the whole Body kill; 
For never had You Pow'r but to Destroy, 
Nor Will, but where You Conquer'd to Enjoy. 
This was Your Master-prize, who did intend 
To make both Churhch and Kingdom's prey Your End. 
'Gainst which the King (plac'd in the Gap) did strive 
By His (till then unquestion'd) Negative, 
Which finding You lack'd Reason to perswade, 
Your Arguments are into Weapons made; 
So to compell him by main force to yield, 
You had a Formed Army in the Field 
Before his Reared Standard could invite
Ten men upon his Righteous Cause to fight. 
Yet ere those raised Forces did advance, 
Your malice struck him dead by Ordinance, 
When your Commissions the whole Kingdom swept 
With Blood and Slaughter, Not the King Except. 
Now hardned in Revolt, You next proceed 
By Pacts to strengthen each Rebellious Deed, 
New Oaths, and Vows, and Covenants advance, 
All contradicting your Allegiance, 
Whose Sacred knot you plainly did unty, 
When you with Essex swore to Live and Die. 
These were your Calves in Bethel and in Dan, 
Which Jeroboam's Treason stablish can,
Who by strange Pacts and Altars did seduce 
The People to their Laws and and King's abuse; 
All which but serve like Soibboleth to try 
Those who pronounc'd not your Conspiracy; 
That when your other Trains defective are, 
Forc'd Oaths might bring Refusers to the Snare. 
And lest those men your Counsels did pervert, 
Might when your Fraud was seen the Cause desert, 
A fierce Decree is through the Kingdom sent, 
Which made it Death for any to Repent. 
What strange Dilemmaes doth Rebellion make? 
'Tis mortal to Deny, or to Partake: 
Some Hang who would not aid your Traiterous Act, 
Others engag'd are Hang'd if they Retract. 
So Witches who their Contracts have unsworn, 
By their own Devils are in pieces torn. 
Thus still the rageing Tempest higher grows, 
Which in Extreams the Kings Resolving throws. 
The face of Ruine every where appears, 
And Acts of Outrage multiply our fears; 
Whilst blind Ambition by Successes fed 
Hath You beyond the bound of Subjects led, 
Who tasting once the sweet of Regal Sway, 
Resolved now no longer to obey. 
For Presbyterian pride contests as high 
As doth the Popedom for Supremacy. 
Needs must you with unskilful Phaeton 
Aspire to guide the Chariot of the Sun, 
Though your ill-govern'd height with lightning be 
Thrown headlong from his burning Axle-tree. 
You will no more Petition or Debate, 
But your desire in Propositions state,
Which by such Rules and Ties the King confine, 
They in effect are Summons to Resign. 
Therefore your War is manag'd with such sleight, 
'Twas seen you more prevail'd by Purse than Might; 
And those you could not purchase to your will, 
You brib'd with sums of mony to sit still. 
The King by this time hopelesse here of Peace, 
Or to procure His wasted Peoples ease, 
Which He in frequent Messages had try'd, 
By you as oft as shamelesly deny'd; 
Wearied by faithlesse Friends and restlesse Foes, 
To certain hazard doth His Life Expose: 
When through your Quarters in a mean disguise
He to His Country-men for succour flies, 
Who met a brave occasion then to save 
Their Native King from His untimely Grave: 
Had he from them such fair reception gain'd, 
Wherewith ev'n Achish David entertain'd. 
But Faith to Him or hospitable Laws 
In your Confederate Union were no Clause, 
Which back to you their Rendred Master sends 
To tell how He was us'd among his friends. 
Far be it from my thoughts by this black Line 
To measure all within that Warlick Clime; 
The still admir'd Montross some Numbers lead 
In his brave steps of Loyalty to tread. 
I onely tax a furious Party There, 
Who with our Native Pests Enleagued were. 
Then 'twas you follow'd Him with Hue and Cry, 
Made Midnight Searches in Each Liberty, 
Voting it death to all without Reprieve, 
Who should their Master Harbor or Relieve. 
Ev'n in pure pitty of both Nations Fame, 
I wish that Act in Story had no name. 
When all your Mutual Stipulations are 
Converted at Newcastle to a Fair, 
Where (like His Lord) the King the Mart is made, 
Bought with Your Mony, and by Them Betraid; 
For both are guilty, They that did Contract, 
And You that did the fatal Bargain Act. 
Which who by equal Reason shall peruse, 
Must yet conclude, They had the best Excuse: 
For doubtlesse They (Good men) had never sold, 
But that you tempted Them with English Gold; 
And 'tis no wonder if with such a Sum 
Our Brethrens frailty might be overcome. 
What though hereafter it may prove Their Lot 
To be compared with Iscariot? 
Yet will the World perceive which was most wise, 
And who the Nobler Traitor by the Price; 
For though 'tis true Both did Themselves undo, 
They made the better Bargain of the Two, 
Which all may reckon who can difference 
Two hundred thousand Pounds from Thirty Pence. 
However something is in Justice due, 
Which may be spoken in defence of You; 
For in your Masters Purchase you gave more, 
Than all your Jewish kindred paid before. 
And had you wisely us'd what then you bought, 
Your Act might be a Loyal Ransom thought, 
To free from Bonds your Captive Soverain, 
Restoring Him to his lost Crown again. 
But You had other plots, you busie hate 
Ply'd all advantage on His fallen State, 
And shew'd You did not come to bring Him Bayl, 
But to remove Him to a stricter Gaol, 
To Holmby first, whence taken from His Bed, 
He by an Army was in triumph led; 
Till on pretence of safety Cromwel's wile 
Had juggel'd Him into the Fatal Isle, 
Where Hammond for his Jaylor is decreed, 
And Murderous Rolf as Lieger-Hangman fee'd, 
Who in one fatal Knot Two Counsels tye, 
He must by Poison or by Pistol Die. 
Here now deny'd all Comforts due to Life, 
His Friends, His Children, and His Peerlesse Wife; 
From Carisbrook He oft but vainly sends, 
And though first Wrong'd, seeks to make you Amends; 
For this He sues, and by His restlesse Pen 
Importunes Your deaf Ears to Treat agen. 
Whilst the proud Faction scorning to go lesse, 
Return those Trait'rous Votes of Non Address, 
Which follow'd were by th'Armies thundring
To Act without and quite against the King. 
Yet when that Clowd remov'd, and the clear Light, 
Drawn from His weighty Reasons, gave You sight 
Of Your own dangers, had not Their Intents 
Retarded been by some crosse Accidents; 
Which for a while with fortunate Suspense 
Check'd or diverted Their swoln Insolence: 
When the whole Kingdom for a Treaty cry'd, 
Which gave such credit to Your falling side, 
That you Recall'd those Votes, and God once more 
Your Power to save the Kingdom did restore, 
Remember how Your peevish Treators sate, 
Not to make Peace, but to prolong Debate; 
How You that precious time at first delay'd, 
And what ill use of Your advantage made, 
As if from Your foul hands God had decreed 
Nothing but War and Mischief should succeed. 
For when by easie Grants the Kings Assent 
Did your desires in greater things prevent, 
When He did yield faster than You intreat, 
And more than Modesty dares well repeat; 
Yet not content with this, without all sense, 
Or of His Honor or His Conscience, 
Still you prest on, till you too late descry'd, 
'Twas now lesse safe to stay than be deny'd. 
For like a Flood broke loose the Armed Rout, 
Then Shut Him closer up, And Shut You out, 
Who by just vengeance are since Worryed 
By those Hand-wolves You for His Ruine bred. 
Thus like Two Smoaking Firebrands, You and They 
Have in this Smother choak'd the Kingdom's Day. 
And as you rais'd Them first, must share the Guilt, 
With all the Blood in those Distractions spilt. 
For though with Sampson's Foxes backward turn'd, 
(When he Philistia's fruitful Harvest burn'd) 
The face of your opinions stands averse, 
All your Conclusions but one fire disperse; 
And every Line which carries your Designes, 
In the same Centre of Confusion joyns. 
Though then the Independents end the Work, 
'Tis known they took their Platform from the Kirk; 
Though Pilate Bradshaw with his pack of Jews 
God's High Vice-gerent at the Bar accuse, 
They but reviv'd the Evidence and Charge 
Your poys'nous Declarations laid at large; 
Though they condemn'd or made his Life their Spoil, 
You were the Setters forc'd him to the Toil: 
For you whose fatal hand the Warrant writ, 
The Prisoner did for Execution fit. 
And if their Ax invade the Regal Throat, 
Remember you first murther'd Him by Vote. 
Thus They receive Your Tennis at the bound, 
Take off that Head which you had first Un-crown'd; 
Which shews the Texture of our Mischiefs Clew, 
If ravel'd to the Top, begins in You, 
Who have forever stain'd the brave Intents 
And Credit of our English Parliaments: 
And in this One caus'd greater Ills, and more, 
Than all of theirs did Good that went before. 
Yet have you kept your word against Your will, 
Your King is Great indeed and Glorious still, 
And you have made Him so. We must impute 
That Lustre which His Sufferings contribute 
To your preposterous Wisdoms, who have done 
All your good Deeds by Contradiction: 
For as to work His Peace you rais'd this Strife, 
And often Shot at Him to Save His Life; 
As you took from Him to Encrease His wealth, 
And kept Him Pris'ner to secure His Health: 
So in revenge of your dissembled Spight, 
In this last Wrong you did Him greatest Right, 
And (cross to all you meant) by Plucking down 
Lifted Him up to His Eternal Crown. 
With This encircled in that radiant Sphear, 
Where Thy black Murtherers must ne'r appear, 
Thou from th'enthroned Martyrs Blood-stain'd Line, 
Dost in thy Vertues bright Example shine. 
And when Thy darted Beam from the moist Sky 
Nightly salutes Thy grieving Peoples Eye, 
Thou like some Warning Light rais'd by our fears, 
Shalt both provoke and still supply our Tears: 
Til the Great Prophet wak'd from his long sleep 
Again bids Sion for Josiah weep: 
That all Successions by a firm Decree 
May teach Their Children to lament for Thee. 
Beyond these mournful Rites there is no Art 
Or Cost can Thee preserve. Thy better Part 
Lives in despight of Death, and will endure 
Kept safe in Thy unpattern'd Portraicture: 
Which though in Paper drawn by thine own Hand, 
Shall longer than Corinthian-Marble stand, 
Or Iron Sculptures: There Thy matchlesse Pen 
Speaks Thee the Best of Kings as Best of Men: 
Be this Thy Epitaph: for This alone 
Deserves to carry Thy Inscription. 
And 'tis but modest Truth: so may I thrive) 
As not to please the Best of Thine Alive, 
Of flatter my dead Master, here would I 
Pay my last Duty in a Gloriovs Ly) 
In that Admired Piece the world may read 
Thy Vertues and Misfortunes Storied; 
Which bear such curious Mixture, men must doubt 
Whether Thou Wiser wert or more Devout. 
There live Blest Relick of a Saint-like mind, 
With Honors endlesse, as Thy Peace Enshrin'd. 
Whilst we, divided by that Bloody Clowd, 
Whose purple Mists Thy Murther'd Body shrowd, 
Here stay behind at gaze: Apt for Thy sake 
Unruly murmurs now 'gainst Heav'n to make, 
Which binds us to Live well, yet gives no Fense 
To guard her dearest Sons from Violence. 
But He whose Trump proclaims, Revenge is Mine, 
Bids us our Sorrow by our Hope confine, 
And reconcile our Reason to our Faith, 
Which in Thy Ruine such Concussions hath, 
It dares Conclude, God does not keep His Word 
If Zimri die in Peace that slew his Lord. ",Elegy
