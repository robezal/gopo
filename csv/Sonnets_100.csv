0,Pablo Neruda,Sonnet Lxxxi,"And now you're mine. Rest with your dream in my dream.
Love and pain and work should all sleep, now.
The night turns on its invisible wheels,
and you are pure beside me as a sleeping amber.

No one else, Love, will sleep in my dreams. You will go,
we will go together, over the waters of time.
No one else will travel through the shadows with me,
only you, evergreen, ever sun, ever moon.

Your hands have already opened their delicate fists
and let their soft drifting signs drop away; your eyes closed like two gray
wings, and I move

after, following the folding water you carry, that carries
me away. The night, the world, the wind spin out their destiny.
Without you, I am your dream, only that, and that is all.",Sonnet
1,John Keats,His Last Sonnet,"Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art! - 
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night,
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like Nature's patient sleepless Eremite,
The moving waters at their priestlike task
Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,
Or gazing on the new soft fallen mask
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors - 
No -yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,
Pillowed upon my fair love's ripening breast,
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,
Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,
And so live ever -or else swoon to death.",Sonnet
2,Pablo Neruda,Sonnet Xi,"I crave your mouth, your voice, your hair.
Silent and starving, I prowl through the streets.
Bread does not nourish me, dawn disrupts me, all day
I hunt for the liquid measure of your steps.

I hunger for your sleek laugh,
your hands the color of a savage harvest,
hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails,
I want to eat your skin like a whole almond.

I want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body,
the sovereign nose of your arrogant face,
I want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes,

and I pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight,
hunting for you, for your hot heart,
like a puma in the barrens of Quitratue.",Sonnet
3,Pablo Neruda,Sonnet Viii,"If your eyes were not the color of the moon,
of a day full [here, interrupted by the baby waking -- continued about 26
hours later ]
of a day full of clay, and work, and fire,
if even held-in you did not move in agile grace like the air,
if you were not an amber week,

not the yellow moment
when autumn climbs up through the vines;
if you were not that bread the fragrant moon
kneads, sprinkling its flour across the sky,

oh, my dearest, I could not love you so!
But when I hold you I hold everything that is --
sand, time, the tree of the rain,

everything is alive so that I can be alive:
without moving I can see it all:
in your life I see everything that lives.",Sonnet
4,Edgar Allan Poe,Sonnet- Silence,"There are some qualities- some incorporate things,
        That have a double life, which thus is made
      A type of that twin entity which springs
        From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.
      There is a two-fold Silence- sea and shore-
        Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,
        Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,
      Some human memories and tearful lore,
      Render him terrorless: his name's ""No More.""
      He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!
        No power hath he of evil in himself;
      But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)
        Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,
      That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
      No foot of man,) commend thyself to God!",Sonnet
5,John Milton,"Sonnet Vii: How Soon Hath Time, The Subt..","How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth, 
Stoln on his wing my three and twentieth year! 
My hasting days fly on wtih full career, 
But my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th. 
Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth, 
That I to manhood am arrived so near, 
And inward ripeness doth much less appear, 
That some more timely-happy spirits endu'th. 
Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow, 
It shall be still in strictest measure even 
To that same lot, however mean or high, 
Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven; 
All is, if I have grace to use it so, 
As ever in my great Taskmaster's eye.",Sonnet
6,John Donne,Holy Sonnet X: Death Be Not Proud,"Death, be not proud, though some have callèd thee
Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;
For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow
Die not, poor death, nor yet canst thou kill me.
From rest and sleep, which yet thy pictures be,
Much pleasure, then from thee much more, must low
And soonest our best men with thee do go,
Rest of their bones and soul's delivery.
Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings and desperate men
And dost with poison, war and sickness dwell,
And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well
And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then ?
One short sleep past, we wake eternally,
And death shall be no more; death, thou shalt die.",Sonnet
7,Edgar Allan Poe,Sonnet- To Science,"Science! true daughter of Old Time thou art!
      Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.
    Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,
      Vulture, whose wings are dull realities?
    How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,
      Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
    To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,
      Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?
    Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?
      And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
    To seek a shelter in some happier star?
      Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,
    The Elfin from the green grass, and from me
    The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?",Sonnet
8,John Donne,Holy Sonnet I: Thou Hast Made Me,"Thou hast made me, and shall thy work decay?
Repair me now, for now mine end doth haste;
I run to death, and death meets me as fast,
And all my pleasures are like yesterday.
I dare not move my dim eyes any way,
Despair behind, and death before doth cast
Such terror, and my feeble flesh doth waste
By sin in it, which it towards hell doth weigh.
Only thou art above, and when towards thee
By thy leave I can look, I rise again;
But our old subtle foe so tempteth me
That not one hour myself I can sustain.
Thy grace may wing me to prevent his art,
And thou like adamant draw mine iron heart.",Sonnet
9,Sir John Suckling,Sonnet I,"Dost see how unregarded now
        That piece of beauty passes?
There was a time when I did vow
        To that alone;
    But mark the fate of faces;
The red and white works now no more on me
Than if it could not charm, or I not see.

And yet the face continues good,
        And I have still desires,
Am still the selfsame flesh and blood,
        As apt to melt
    And suffer from those fires;
Oh some kind pow'r unriddle where it lies,
Whether my heart be faulty, or her eyes?

She ev'ry day her man does kill,
        And I as often die;
Neither her power then, nor my will
        Can question'd be.
    What is the mystery?
Sure beauty's empires, like to greater states,
Have certain periods set, and hidden fates.",Sonnet
10,Rupert Brooke,A Memory (From A Sonnet- Sequence),"Somewhile before the dawn I rose, and stept
 Softly along the dim way to your room,
 And found you sleeping in the quiet gloom,
And holiness about you as you slept.
I knelt there; till your waking fingers crept
 About my head, and held it.  I had rest
 Unhoped this side of Heaven, beneath your breast.
I knelt a long time, still; nor even wept.

It was great wrong you did me; and for gain
Of that poor moment's kindliness, and ease,
And sleepy mother-comfort!
                            Child, you know
How easily love leaps out to dreams like these,
Who has seen them true.  And love that's wakened so
Takes all too long to lay asleep again.",Sonnet
11,Edgar Allan Poe,Sonnet- To Zante,"Fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers,
        Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take!
      How many memories of what radiant hours
        At sight of thee and thine at once awake!
      How many scenes of what departed bliss!
        How many thoughts of what entombed hopes!
      How many visions of a maiden that is
        No more- no more upon thy verdant slopes!
      No more! alas, that magical sad sound
        Transforming all! Thy charms shall please no more-
      Thy memory no more! Accursed ground
        Henceforth I hold thy flower-enameled shore,
      O hyacinthine isle! O purple Zante!
        ""Isola d'oro! Fior di Levante!""",Sonnet
12,Elizabeth Bishop,Sonnet,"I am in need of music that would flow
Over my fretful, feeling finger-tips,
Over my bitter-tainted, trembling lips,
With melody, deep, clear, and liquid-slow.
Oh, for the healing swaying, old and low,
Of some song sung to rest the tired dead,
A song to fall like water on my head,
And over quivering limbs, dream flushed to glow!

There is a magic made by melody:
A spell of rest, and quiet breath, and cool
Heart, that sinks through fading colors deep
To the subaqueous stillness of the sea,
And floats forever in a moon-green pool,
Held in the arms of rhythm and of sleep.",Sonnet
13,John Donne,Holy Sonnet Xiv: Batter My Heart,"Batter my heart, three-personed God; for You
As yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend;
That I may rise and stand, o'erthrow me,'and bend
Your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new.
I, like an usurped town, to'another due,
Labor to'admit You, but O, to no end;
Reason, Your viceroy'in me, me should defend,
But is captived, and proves weak or untrue.
Yet dearly'I love You,'and would be loved fain,
But am betrothed unto Your enemy.
Divorce me,'untie or break that knot again;
Take me to You, imprison me, for I
Except You'enthrall me, never shall be free,
Nor ever chaste, except You ravish me.",Sonnet
14,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"Sonnet X: Yet Love, Mere Love","Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed 
And worthy of acceptation. Fire is bright, 
Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light 
Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed: 
And love is fire. And when I say at need 
I love thee...mark!...I love thee--in thy sight 
I stand transfigured, glorified aright, 
With conscience of the new rays that proceed 
Out of my face toward thine. There's nothing low 
In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures 
Who love God, God accepts while loving so. 
And what I feel, across the inferior features 
Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show 
How that great work of Love enhances Nature's.",Sonnet
15,Federico García Lorca,Sonnet Of The Sweet Complaint,"Never let me lose the marvel 
of your statue-like eyes, or the accent 
the solitary rose of your breath 
places on my cheek at night.

I am afraid of being, on this shore, 
a branchless trunk, and what I most regret 
is having no flower, pulp, or clay 
for the worm of my despair.

If you are my hidden treasure, 
if you are my cross, my dampened pain, 
if I am a dog, and you alone my master,

never let me lose what I have gained, 
and adorn the branches of your river 
with leaves of my estranged Autumn.",Sonnet
16,William Shakespeare,Sonnet Cxvi: Let Me Not To The Marriage ..,"Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove:
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
It is the star to every wandering bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle's compass come:
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
If this be error and upon me proved,
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.",Sonnet
17,John Donne,Holy Sonnet Iv: Oh My Black Soul!,"Oh my black soul! now art thou summoned
By sickness, death's herald, and champion;
Thou art like a pilgrim, which abroad hath done
Treason, and durst not turn to whence he is fled;
Or like a thief, which till death's doom be read,
Wisheth himself delivered from prison,
But damned and haled to execution,
Wisheth that still he might be imprisoned.
Yet grace, if thou repent, thou canst not lack;
But who shall give thee that grace to begin?
Oh make thy self with holy mourning black,
And red with blushing, as thou art with sin;
Or wash thee in Christ's blood, which hath this might
That being red, it dyes red souls to white.",Sonnet
18,Christina Georgina Rossetti,Monna Innominata: A Sonnet Of Sonnets,"1

Lo dì che han detto a' dolci amici addio. - Dante
Amor, con quanto sforzo oggi mi vinci! - Petrarca

Come back to me, who wait and watch for you:--
Or come not yet, for it is over then,
And long it is before you come again,
So far between my pleasures are and few.
While, when you come not, what I do I do
Thinking ""Now when he comes,"" my sweetest when:""
For one man is my world of all the men
This wide world holds; O love, my world is you.
Howbeit, to meet you grows almost a pang
Because the pang of parting comes so soon;
My hope hangs waning, waxing, like a moon
Between the heavenly days on which we meet:
Ah me, but where are now the songs I sang
When life was sweet because you call'd them sweet? 

2 

Era già 1'ora che volge il desio. - Dante
Ricorro al tempo ch' io vi vidi prima. - Petrarca

I wish I could remember that first day,
First hour, first moment of your meeting me,
If bright or dim the season, it might be
Summer or winter for aught I can say;
So unrecorded did it slip away,
So blind was I to see and to foresee,
So dull to mark the budding of my tree
That would not blossom yet for many a May.
If only I could recollect it, such
A day of days! I let it come and go
As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow;
It seem'd to mean so little, meant so much;
If only now I could recall that touch,
First touch of hand in hand--Did one but know! 


3 

O ombre vane, fuor che ne l'aspetto!  - Dante
Immaginata guida la conduce. - Petrarca

I dream of you to wake: would that I might
Dream of you and not wake but slumber on;
Nor find with dreams the dear companion gone,
As summer ended summer birds take flight.
In happy dreams I hold you full in sight,
I blush again who waking look so wan;
Brighter than sunniest day that ever shone,
In happy dreams your smile makes day of night.
Thus only in a dream we are at one,
Thus only in a dream we give and take
The faith that maketh rich who take or give;
If thus to sleep is sweeter than to wake,
To die were surely sweeter than to live,
Though there be nothing new beneath the sun. 


4 

Poca favilla gran fliamma seconda. - Dante
Ogni altra cosa, ogni pensier va fore,
E sol ivi con voi rimansi amore.  - Petrarca

I lov'd you first: but afterwards your love
Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song
As drown'd the friendly cooings of my dove.
Which owes the other most? my love was long,
And yours one moment seem'd to wax more strong;
I lov'd and guess'd at you, you construed me--
And lov'd me for what might or might not be
Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.
For verily love knows not ""mine"" or ""thine;""
With separate ""I"" and ""thou"" free love has done,
For one is both and both are one in love:
Rich love knows nought of ""thine that is not mine;""
Both have the strength and both the length thereof,
Both of us, of the love which makes us one. 


5 

Amor che a nullo amato amar perdona. - Dante
Amor m'addusse in sì gioiosa spene. - Petrarca

O my heart's heart, and you who are to me
More than myself myself, God be with you,
Keep you in strong obedience leal and true
To Him whose noble service setteth free,
Give you all good we see or can foresee,
Make your joys many and your sorrows few,
Bless you in what you bear and what you do,
Yea, perfect you as He would have you be.
So much for you; but what for me, dear friend?
To love you without stint and all I can
Today, tomorrow, world without an end;
To love you much and yet to love you more,
As Jordan at his flood sweeps either shore;
Since woman is the helpmeet made for man. 


6 

Or puoi la quantitate
Comprender de l'amor che a te mi scalda. - Dante
Non vo' che da tal nodo mi scioglia.  - Petrarca

Trust me, I have not earn'd your dear rebuke,
I love, as you would have me, God the most;
Would lose not Him, but you, must one be lost,
Nor with Lot's wife cast back a faithless look
Unready to forego what I forsook;
This say I, having counted up the cost,
This, though I be the feeblest of God's host,
The sorriest sheep Christ shepherds with His crook.
Yet while I love my God the most, I deem
That I can never love you overmuch;
I love Him more, so let me love you too;
Yea, as I apprehend it, love is such
I cannot love you if I love not Him,
I cannot love Him if I love not you. 


7 

Qui primavera sempre ed ogni frutto. - Dante
Ragionando con meco ed io con lui.  - Petrarca

""Love me, for I love you""--and answer me,
""Love me, for I love you""--so shall we stand
As happy equals in the flowering land
Of love, that knows not a dividing sea.
Love builds the house on rock and not on sand,
Love laughs what while the winds rave desperately;
And who hath found love's citadel unmann'd?
And who hath held in bonds love's liberty?
My heart's a coward though my words are brave
We meet so seldom, yet we surely part
So often; there's a problem for your art!
Still I find comfort in his Book, who saith,
Though jealousy be cruel as the grave,
And death be strong, yet love is strong as death. 


8 

Come dicesse a Dio: D'altro non calme.  - Dante
Spero trovar pietà non che perdono.  - Petrarca

""I, if I perish, perish""--Esther spake:
And bride of life or death she made her fair
In all the lustre of her perfum'd hair
And smiles that kindle longing but to slake.
She put on pomp of loveliness, to take
Her husband through his eyes at unaware;
She spread abroad her beauty for a snare,
Harmless as doves and subtle as a snake.
She trapp'd him with one mesh of silken hair,
She vanquish'd him by wisdom of her wit,
And built her people's house that it should stand:--
If I might take my life so in my hand,
And for my love to Love put up my prayer,
And for love's sake by Love be granted it! 


9 

O dignitosa coscienza e netta! - Dante
Spirto più acceso di virtuti ardenti. - Petrarca

Thinking of you, and all that was, and all
That might have been and now can never be,
I feel your honour'd excellence, and see
Myself unworthy of the happier call:
For woe is me who walk so apt to fall,
So apt to shrink afraid, so apt to flee,
Apt to lie down and die (ah, woe is me!)
Faithless and hopeless turning to the wall.
And yet not hopeless quite nor faithless quite,
Because not loveless; love may toil all night,
But take at morning; wrestle till the break
Of day, but then wield power with God and man:--
So take I heart of grace as best I can,
Ready to spend and be spent for your sake. 


10 

Con miglior corso e con migliore stella.  - Dante
La vita fugge e non s'arresta un' ora.  - Petrarca

Time flies, hope flags, life plies a wearied wing;
Death following hard on life gains ground apace;
Faith runs with each and rears an eager face,
Outruns the rest, makes light of everything,
Spurns earth, and still finds breath to pray and sing;
While love ahead of all uplifts his praise,
Still asks for grace and still gives thanks for grace,
Content with all day brings and night will bring.
Life wanes; and when love folds his wings above
Tired hope, and less we feel his conscious pulse,
Let us go fall asleep, dear friend, in peace:
A little while, and age and sorrow cease;
A little while, and life reborn annuls
Loss and decay and death, and all is love. 


11 

Vien dietro a me e lascia dir le genti. - Dante
Contando i casi della vita nostra.  - Petrarca

Many in aftertimes will say of you
""He lov'd her""--while of me what will they say?
Not that I lov'd you more than just in play,
For fashion's sake as idle women do.
Even let them prate; who know not what we knew
Of love and parting in exceeding pain,
Of parting hopeless here to meet again,
Hopeless on earth, and heaven is out of view.
But by my heart of love laid bare to you,
My love that you can make not void nor vain,
Love that foregoes you but to claim anew
Beyond this passage of the gate of death,
I charge you at the Judgment make it plain
My love of you was life and not a breath. 


12 

Amor, che ne la mente mi ragiona. - Dante
Amor vien nel bel viso di costei.  - Petrarca

If there be any one can take my place
And make you happy whom I grieve to grieve,
Think not that I can grudge it, but believe
I do commend you to that nobler grace,
That readier wit than mine, that sweeter face;
Yea, since your riches make me rich, conceive
I too am crown'd, while bridal crowns I weave,
And thread the bridal dance with jocund pace.
For if I did not love you, it might be
That I should grudge you some one dear delight;
But since the heart is yours that was mine own,
Your pleasure is my pleasure, right my right,
Your honourable freedom makes me free,
And you companion'd I am not alone. 


13 

E drizzeremo gli occhi al Primo Amore. - Dante
Ma trovo peso non da le mie braccia.  - Petrarca

If I could trust mine own self with your fate,
Shall I not rather trust it in God's hand?
Without Whose Will one lily doth not stand,
Nor sparrow fall at his appointed date;
Who numbereth the innumerable sand,
Who weighs the wind and water with a weight,
To Whom the world is neither small nor great,
Whose knowledge foreknew every plan we plann'd.
Searching my heart for all that touches you,
I find there only love and love's goodwill
Helpless to help and impotent to do,
Of understanding dull, of sight most dim;
And therefore I commend you back to Him
Whose love your love's capacity can fill. 


14 

E la Sua Volontade è nostra pace. - Dante
Sol con questi pensier, con altre chiome.  - Petrarca

Youth gone, and beauty gone if ever there
Dwelt beauty in so poor a face as this;
Youth gone and beauty, what remains of bliss?
I will not bind fresh roses in my hair,
To shame a cheek at best but little fair,--
Leave youth his roses, who can bear a thorn,--
I will not seek for blossoms anywhere,
Except such common flowers as blow with corn.
Youth gone and beauty gone, what doth remain?
The longing of a heart pent up forlorn,
A silent heart whose silence loves and longs;
The silence of a heart which sang its songs
While youth and beauty made a summer morn,
Silence of love that cannot sing again.",Sonnet
19,John Donne,Holy Sonnet ?,"Thou hast made me, and shall thy work decay?
     Repair me now, for now mine end doth haste,
     I run to death, and death meets me as fast,
     And all my pleasures are like yesterday;
     I dare not move my dim eyes any way,
     Despair behind, and death before doth cast
     Such terror, and my feebled flesh doth waste
     By sin in it, which it t'wards hell doth weigh.
     Only thou art above, and when towards thee
   By thy leave I can look, I rise again;
   But our old subtle foe so tempteth me,
   That not one hour I can myself sustain;
   Thy grace may wing me to prevent his art,
   And thou like adamant draw mine iron heart.",Sonnet
20,John Donne,Holy Sonnet Xvii: Since She Whom I Loved,"Since she whom I loved hath paid her last debt
To Nature, and to hers, and my good is dead,
And her soul early into heaven ravished,
Wholly on heavenly things my mind is set.
here the admiring her my mind did whet
To seek thee, God; so streams do show the head;
But though I have found thee, and thou my thirst hast fed,
a holy thristy dropsy melts me yet.
But why should I beg more love, whenas thou
Dost woo my soul, for hers offering all thine:
And dost not only fear lest I allow
My love to saints and angels, things divine,
but in they tender jealousy dost doubt
lest the world, flesh, yea, devil put thee out.",Sonnet
21,George Barker,Sonnet To My Mother,"Most near, most dear, most loved, and most far,
Under the huge window where I often found her
Sitting as huge as Asia, seismic with laughter,
Gin and chicken helpless in her Irish hand,
Irresistible as Rabelais but most tender for
The lame dogs and hurt birds that surround her,—
She is a procession no one can follow after
But be like a little dog following a brass band.
She will not glance up at the bomber or condescend
To drop her gin and scuttle to a cellar,
But lean on the mahogany table like a mountain
Whom only faith can move, and so I send
O all her faith and all my love to tell her
That she will move from mourning into morning.",Sonnet
22,Tamara Beryl Latham,Sonnet On A Star,"If I could write a sonnet 
on a star 
Then bottle it and 
toss it to the sea 
Would it travel 
to the corners of the Earth, 
And echo there 
the love I hold for thee? If I could write a sonnet 
on the moon 
Then bottle it and 
toss it to the winds 
Would it find your heart 
So you may briefly know, 
Where your love ends 
Is where my love begins? If I could write a sonnet 
on the sun 
Then bottle it and 
toss it throughout time 
Would someone from a distant galaxy 
Find no greater love 
Than that was mine Yet, I cannot write a sonnet 
on a star, 
Nor moon, nor even on 
the blazing sun, 
Nor bottle words to send them 
Where you are 
Nor coerce our separate hearts 
To beat as one And so my darling 
You will never hear 
The humble words of love 
I wrote for thee 
They remain encrypted, 
tightly sealed 
And yet they travel 
on eternally",Sonnet
23,Oscar Wilde,Sonnet To Liberty,"NOT that I love thy children, whose dull eyes
            See nothing save their own unlovely woe,
            Whose minds know nothing, nothing care to know,--
            But that the roar of thy Democracies,
            Thy reigns of Terror, thy great Anarchies,
            Mirror my wildest passions like the sea,--
            And give my rage a brother----! Liberty!
            For this sake only do thy dissonant cries
            Delight my discreet soul, else might all kings
            By bloody knout or treacherous cannonades
            Rob nations of their rights inviolate
            And I remain unmoved--and yet, and yet,

            God knows it I am with them, in some things.",Sonnet
24,John Donne,Holy Sonnet V: I Am A Little World,"I am a little world made cunningly 
Of Elements, and an Angelike spright, 
But black sinne hath betraid to endlesse night 
My worlds both parts, and (oh) both parts must die. 
You which beyond that heaven which was most high 
Have found new sphears, and of new lands can write,

Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.
From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,
Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow,
And soonest our best men with thee do go,
Rest of their bones, and soul's delivery.
Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,
And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell;
And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well
And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then?
One short sleep past, we wake eternally,
And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.",Sonnet

Mindless of its just honours; with this key 
Shakspeare unlocked his heart; the melody 
Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch's wound; 
A thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound; 
With it Camoens soothed an exile's grief; 
The Sonnet glittered a gay myrtle leaf 
Amid the cypress with which Dante crowned 
His visionary brow: a glow-worm lamp, 
It cheered mild Spenser, called from Faery-land 
To struggle through dark ways; and when a damp 
Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand 
The Thing became a trumpet; whence he blew 
Soul-animating strains--alas, too few!",Sonnet

I drop it at thy feet. I cannot teach
My hand to hold my spirit so far off
From myself.. me.. that I should bring thee proof,
In words of love hid in me...out of reach.
Nay, let the silence of my womanhood
Commend my woman-love to thy belief,
Seeing that I stand unwon (however wooed)
And rend the garment of my life in brief

Lest one touch of this heart convey its grief.",Sonnet

Half falling on the hair. O beyond meed!

I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.

Carve it in ivory or in ebony, 
As Day or Night may rule; and let Time see

That this can scarce be right! We are not peers, 
So to be lovers; and I own, and grieve, 
That givers of such gifts as mine are, must 
Be counted with the ungenerous. Out, alas!

This love even, all my worth, to the uttermost, 
I should not love withal, unless that thou

When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed, 
And love called love. And thus, I cannot speak 
Of love even, as good thing of my own:

The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,
Those of my own life, who by turns had flung
A shadow across me. Straightway I was 'ware,
So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move
Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair:

 Love is flung Lucifer-like from Heaven to Hell.

 Who cry for shadows, clutch, and cannot tell
Whether they love at all, or, loving, whom:
 An old song's lady, a fool in fancy dress,

To conquer grief, tries more, as all things prove;

Dear friends, together in the glimmering eve, 
Pensive and glad, with tones that recognise 
The soft invisible dew in each one's eyes,
