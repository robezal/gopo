0,Anne Sexton,A Curse Against Elegies,"Oh, love, why do we argue like this? 
I am tired of all your pious talk.
Also, I am tired of all the dead.
They refuse to listen, 
so leave them alone.
Take your foot out of the graveyard, 
they are busy being dead.

Everyone was always to blame: 
the last empty fifth of booze, 
the rusty nails and chicken feathers
that stuck in the mud on the back doorstep, 
the worms that lived under the cat's ear
and the thin-lipped preacher
who refused to call
except once on a flea-ridden day
when he came scuffing in through the yard
looking for a scapegoat.
I hid in the kitchen under the ragbag.

I refuse to remember the dead.
And the dead are bored with the whole thing.
But you - you go ahead, 
go on, go on back down
into the graveyard, 
lie down where you think their faces are; 
talk back to your old bad dreams.",Elegy
1,Rainer Maria Rilke,Duino Elegies: The First Elegy,"Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angels'
hierarchies? and even if one of them suddenly
pressed me against his heart, I would perish
in the embrace of his stronger existence.
For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror
which we are barely able to endure and are awed
because it serenely disdains to annihilate us.
Each single angel is terrifying.
And so I force myself, swallow and hold back
the surging call of my dark sobbing.
Oh, to whom can we turn for help?
Not angels, not humans;
and even the knowing animals are aware that we feel
little secure and at home in our interpreted world.
There remains perhaps some tree on a hillside
daily for us to see; yesterday's street remains for us
stayed, moved in with us and showed no signs of leaving.
Oh, and the night, the night, when the wind
full of cosmic space invades our frightened faces.
Whom would it not remain for -that longed-after,
gently disenchanting night, painfully there for the
solitary heart to achieve? Is it easier for lovers?
Don't you know yet ? Fling out of your arms the 
emptiness into the spaces we breath -perhaps the birds
will feel the expanded air in their more ferven flight.

Yes, the springtime were in need of you. Often a star
waited for you to espy it and sense its light.
A wave rolled toward you out of the distant past,
or as you walked below an open window,
a violin gave itself to your hearing.
All this was trust. But could you manage it?
Were you not always distraught by expectation,
as if all this were announcing the arrival
of a beloved?  (Where would you find a place
to hide her, with all your great strange thoughts 
coming and going and often staying for the night.)
When longing overcomes you, sing of women in love;
for their famous passion is far from immortal enough.
Those whom you almost envy, the abandoned and
desolate ones, whom you found so much more loving
than those gratified. Begin ever new again
the praise you cannot attain; remember:
the hero lives on and survives; even his downfall
was for him only a pretext for achieving
his final birth. But nature, exhausted, takes lovers
back into itself, as if such creative forces could never be
achieved a second time.
Have you thought of Gaspara Stampa sufficiently:

that any girl abandoned by her lover may feel
from that far intenser example of loving:
""Ah, might I become like her!"" Should not their oldest
sufferings finally become more fruitful for us?
Is it not time that lovingly we freed ourselves
from the beloved and, quivering, endured:
as the arrow endures the bow-string's tension,
and in this tense release becomes more than itself.
For staying is nowhere.

Voices, voices. Listen my heart, as only saints
have listened: until the gigantic call lifted them
clear off the ground. Yet they went on, impossibly,
kneeling, completely unawares: so intense was
their listening. Not that you could endure
the voice of God -far from it! But listen
to the voice of the wind and the ceaseless message
that forms itself out of silence. They sweep
toward you now from those who died young.
Whenever they entered a church in Rome or Naples,
did not their fate quietly speak to you as recently
as the tablet did in Santa Maria Formosa?
What do they want of me? to quietly remove
the appearance of suffered injustice that,
at times, hinders a little their spirits from
freely proceeding onward.

Of course, it is strange to inhabit the earth no longer,
to no longer use skills on had barely time to acquire;
not to observe roses and other things that promised
so much in terms of a human future, no longer
to be what one was in infinitely anxious hands;
to even discard one's own name as easily as a child
abandons a broken toy.
Strange, not to desire to continue wishing one's wishes.
Strange to notice all that was related, fluttering
so loosely in space. And being dead is hard work
and full of retrieving before one can gradually feel a
trace of eternity. -Yes, but the liviing make
the mistake of drawing too sharp a distinction.
Angels (they say) are often unable to distinguish
between moving among the living or the dead.
The eternal torrent whirls all ages along with it,
through both realms forever, and their voices are lost in
its thunderous roar.

In the end the early departed have no longer
need of us. One is gently weaned from things
of this world as a child outgrows the need
of its mother's breast. But we who have need 
of those great mysteries, we for whom grief is
so often the source of spiritual growth,
could we exist without them?
Is the legend vain that tells of music's beginning
in the midst of the mourning for Linos?
the daring first sounds of song piercing
the barren numbness, and how in that stunned space
an almost godlike youth suddenly left forever,
and the emptiness felt for the first time
those harmonious vibrations which now enrapture
and comfort and help us.

2,Rainer Maria Rilke,Duino Elegies: The Tenth Elegy,"That some day, emerging at last from the terrifying vision
I may burst into jubilant praise to assenting angels!
That of the clear-struck keys of the heart not one may fail
to sound because of a loose, doubtful or broken string!
That my streaming countenance may make me more resplendent
That my humble weeping change into blossoms.
Oh, how will you then, nights of suffering, be remembered
with love. Why did I not kneel more fervently, disconsolate
sisters, more bendingly kneel to receive you, more loosely
surrender myself to your loosened hair? We, squanderers of
gazing beyond them to judge the end of their duration.
They are only our winter's foliage, our sombre evergreen,
one of the seasons of our interior year, -not only season,
but place, settlement, camp, soil and dwelling.

How woeful, strange, are the alleys of the City of Pain,
where in the false silence created from too much noise,
a thing cast out from the mold of emptiness
swaggers that gilded hubbub, the bursting memorial.
Oh, how completely an angel would stamp out their market
of solace, bounded by the church, bought ready for use:
as clean, disappointing and closed as a post office on Sunday.
Farther out, though, there are always the rippling edges
of the fair. Seasaws of freedom! High-divers and jugglers of zeal!
And the shooting-gallery's targets of bedizened happiness:
targets tumbling in tinny contortions whenever some better
marksman happens to hit one. From cheers to chance he goes
staggering on, as booths that can please the most curious tastes
are drumming and bawling. For adults ony there is something
special to see: how money multiplies. Anatomy made amusing!
Money's organs on view! Nothing concealed! Instructive,
and guaranteed to increase fertility!...

                                                            Oh, and then outside,
behind the farthest billboard, pasted with posters for 'Deathless,'
that bitter beer tasting quite sweet to drinkers,
if they chew fresh diversions with it..
Behind the billboard, just in back of it, life is real.
Children play, and lovers hold each other, -aside,
earnestly, in the trampled grass, and dogs respond to nature.
The youth continues onward; perhaps he is in love with
a young Lament....he follows her into the meadows.
She says: the way is long. We live out there....
                                                        Where? And the youth
follows. He is touched by her gentle bearing. The shoulders,
the neck, -perhaps she is of noble ancestry? 
Yet he leaves her, turns around, looks back and waves...
What could come of it? She is a Lament.

Only those who died young, in their first state of
timeless serenity, while they are being weaned,
follow her lovingly. She waits for girls
and befriends them. Gently she shows them
what she is wearing. Pearls of grief
and the fine-spun veils of patience.-
With youths she walks in silence.

But there, where they live, in the valley,
an elderly Lament responds to the youth as he asks:-
We were once, she says, a great race, we Laments.
Our fathers worked the mines up there in the mountains;
sometimes among men you will find a piece of polished
primeval pain, or a petrified slag from an ancient volcano.
Yes, that came from there. Once we were rich.-

And she leads him gently through the vast landscape
of Lamentation, shows him the columns of temples,
the ruins of strongholds from which long ago
the princes of Lament wisely governed the country.
Shows him the tall trees of tears,
the fields of flowering sadness,
(the living know them only as softest foliage);
show him the beasts of mourning, grazing-
and sometimes a startled bird, flying straight through
their field of vision, far away traces the image of its
solitary cry.-
At evening she leads him to the graves of elders
of the race of Lamentation, the sybils and prophets.
With night approaching, they move more softly,
and soon there looms ahead, bathed in moonlight,
the sepulcher, that all-guarding ancient stone,
Twin-brother to that on the Nile, the lofty Sphinx-:
the silent chamber's countenance.
They marvel at the regal head that has, forever silent,
laid the features of manking upon the scales of the stars.
His sight, still blinded by his early death,
cannot grasp it. But the Sphinx's gaze
frightens an owl from the rim of the double-crown.
The bird, with slow down-strokes, brushes
along the cheek, that with the roundest curve, 
and faintly inscribes on the new death-born hearing,
as though on the double page of an opened book,
the indescribable outline.

And higher up, the stars. New ones. Stars
of the land of pain. Slowly she names them:
""There, look: the Rider ,the Staff,and that 
crowded constellation they call the the Garland of Fruit.
Then farther up toward the Pole:
Cradle, Way, the Burning Book, Doll, Window.
And in the Southern sky, pure as lines
on the palm of a blessed hand, the clear sparkling M,
standing for Mothers.....""

Yet the dead  youth must go on alone.
In silence the elder Lament brings him
as far as the gorge where it shimmers in the moonlight:
The Foutainhead of Joy. With reverance she names it,
saying: ""In the world of mankind it is a life-bearing stream.""

They reach the foothills of the mountain,
and there she embraces him, weeping.

Alone, he climbs the mountains of primeval pain.
Not even his footsteps ring from this soundless fate.

But were these timeless dead to awaken an image for us,
see, they might be pointing to th catkins, hanging
from the leafless hazels, or else they might mean
the rain that falls upon the dark earth in early Spring.

And we, who always think
of happiness as rising feel the emotion
that almost overwhelms us
whenever a happy thing falls.


Translated by Albert Ernest Flemming",Elegy
3,Rainer Maria Rilke,Duino Elegies: The Fourth Elegy,"O trees of life, oh, what when winter comes?
We are not of one mind. Are not like birds
in unison migrating. And overtaken,
overdue, we thrust ourselves into the wind
and fall to earth into indifferent ponds.
Blossoming and withering we comprehend as one.
And somewhere lions roam, quite unaware,
in their magnificence, of any weaknesss.

But we, while wholly concentrating on one thing,
already feel the pressure of another.
Hatred is our first response. And lovers,
are they not forever invading one another's
boundaries? -although they promised space,
hunting and homeland. Then, for a sketch
drawn at a moment's impulse, a ground of contrast
is prepared, painfully, so that we may see.
For they are most exact with us. We do not know
the contours of our feelings. We only know 
what shapes them from the outside. 

Who has not sat, afraid, before his own heart's
curtain? It lifted and displayed the scenery
of departure. Easy to understand. The well-known
garden swaying just a little. Then came the dancer.
Not he! Enough! However lightly he pretends to move:
he is just disguised, costumed, an ordinary man
who enters through the kitchen when coming home.
I will not have these half-filled human masks;
better the puppet. It at least is full.
I will endure this well-stuffed doll, the wire,
the face that is nothing but appearance. Here out front
I wait. Even if the lights go down and I am told:
""There's nothing  more to come,"" -even if
the grayish drafts of emptiness come drifting down
from the deserted stage -even if not one
of my now silent forebears sist beside me
any longer, not a woman, not even a boy-
he with the brown and squinting eyes-:
I'll still remain. For one can always watch.

Am I not right?  You, to whom life would taste
so bitter, Father, after you - for my sake -
slipped of mine, that first muddy infusion
of my necessity. You kept on tasting, Father,
as I kept on growing, troubled by the aftertaste
of my so strange a future as you kept searching
my unfocused gaze -you who, so often since
you died, have been afraid for my well-being,
within my deepest hope, relinquishing that calmness,
the realms of equanimity such as the dead possess
for my so small fate -Am I not right?

And you, my parents, am I not right? You who loved me
for that small beginning of my love for you
from which I always shyly turned away, because
the distance in your features grew, changed,
even while I loved it, into cosmic space
where you no longer were...: and when I feel
inclined to wait before the puppet stage, no,
rather to stare at is so intensely that in the end
to counter-balance my searching gaze, an angel
has to come as an actor, and begin manipulating
the lifeless bodies of the puppets to perform.
Angel and puppet! Now at last there is a play!
Then what we seperate can come together by our
very presence. And only then the entire cycle
of our own life-seasons is revealed and set in motion.
Above, beyond us, the angel plays. Look:
must not the dying notice how unreal, how full
of pretense is all that we accomplish here, where
nothing is to be itself. O hours of childhood,
when behind each shape more that the past lay hidden,
when that which lay before us was not the future.

We grew, of course, and sometimes were impatient
in growing up,  half for the sake of pleasing those
with nothing left but their own grown-upness.
Yet, when alone, we entertained ourselves
with what alone endures, we would stand there
in the infinite space that spans the world and toys,
upon a place, which from the first beginnniing
had been prepared to serve a pure event.

Who shows a child just as it stands? Who places him
within his constellation, with the measuring-rod
of distance in his hand. Who makes his death
from gray bread that grows hard, -or leaves
it there inside his rounded mouth, jagged as the core
of a sweet apple?.......The minds of murderers
are easily comprehended. But this: to contain death,
the whole of death, even before life has begun,
to hold it all so gently within oneself,
and not be angry: that is indescribable.

4,Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,Roman Elegies I,"Tell me you stones, O speak, you towering palaces!
Streets, say a word! Spirit of this place, are you dumb?
All things are alive in your sacred walls
eternal Rome, only for me all’s still.
Who will whisper to me, at what window
will I see the sweet thing who will kindle me, and quicken?
Already I guess the ways, walking to her and from her,
ever and always I’ll go, while sweet time slips by.
I’m gazing at church and palace, ruin and column,
like a serious man making sensible use of a journey,
but soon it will happen, and all will be one vast temple,
Love’s temple, receiving its new initiate.
Though you are a whole world, Rome, still, without Love,
the world’s not the world, Rome cannot be Rome.",Elegy
5,John Donne,Elegy:The End Of Funeral Elegies,"MADAM—
That I might make your cabinet my tomb, 
And for my fame, which I love next my soul, 
Next to my soul provide the happiest room, 
Admit to that place this last funeral scroll. 
Others by wills give legacies, but I 
Dying, of you do beg a legacy. 

My fortune and my will this custom break, 
When we are senseless grown to make stones speak, 
Though no stone tell thee what I was, yet thou 
In my grave's inside seest what thou art now, 
Yet thou 'rt not yet so good ; till death us lay 
To ripe and mellow there, we're stubborn clay. 
Parents make us earth, and souls dignify 
Us to be glass ; here to grow gold we lie. 
Whilst in our souls sin bred and pamper'd is, 
Our souls become worm-eaten carcases.",Elegy
6,Albert Samain,Elégies,"c' était un soir de grâce et de mansuétude
où l' amour sur les yeux baise la solitude.
Dans l' ombre, une idéale haleine de printemps
passait, comme un soupir, sous les manteaux flottants.
De jardins en jardins ici la ville bleue
au fond du crépuscule expirait en banlieue…
la pluie intermittente et tiède des beaux soirs
avait légèrement mouillé les pavés noirs.
L' avenue était sombre, odorante, et déserte…
les bras nus, et sa robe à la brise entr' ouverte,
la nuit pâle, en rêvant, respirait des lilas;
et la terre était douce et fondait sous les pas.
Jetant vers le voyage un appel symbolique,
parfois un train lointain sifflait, mélancolique;
et des ombres passaient, lentes et parlant bas,
pendant que les grands chiens pleuraient dans les villas.
Soudain d' un pavillon, qu' entourait le mystère,
j' entendis s' élever une voix solitaire
qui vibrait dans le soir comme un beau violon;
et, me penchant un peu, dans un noble salon
où flottait un passé d' Eloas et d' Elvires,
je vis, à la lueur vacillante des cires,
un visage de marbre avec de lourds bandeaux,
et de grands yeux brillants de larmes aux flambeaux.
Anxieux, j' écoutai: la voix ardente et sombre
s' en allait si blessée, et si triste dans l' ombre,
oh ! Si divinement triste, que l' on eût dit
une larme sur le visage de la nuit!…
jamais rien n' atteindra, pour émouvoir notre âme,
le charme surhumain de la voix d' une femme
qui, sur l' ivoire pâle où flotte son bras nu,
raconte au vent nocturne un amour inconnu…
quel secret disiez-vous, et quel mal sans remède,
larges gouttes d' amour tombant dans la nuit tiède,
sanglots d' un coeur que rien ne peut plus contenir,
et qui cède, chargé de trop de souvenir!
L' âme de l' inconnue expirait sur sa lèvre;
ses yeux, ses grands yeux noirs charbonnés par la fièvre
exagéraient encor sa hautaine pâleur;
et sa voix, qui semblait faite pour la douleur
exhalait toute, avec ses cordes épuisées,
l' infini de douceur qu' ont les choses brisées…
je l' écoutais, mêlée à l' odeur des jardins,
au grand silence ému de roulements lointains,
aux diamants de l' ombre, aux brises moelleuses,
au ciel tendre où coulait le lait des nébuleuses,
et je sentais, saisi d' un trouble grandissant,
par degrés s' en aller vers elle, en frémissant,
tout ce qui flotte en nous par de telles soirées
de tendresse ineffable et de pitiés sacrées.
ô toi qui, ce soir-là, répandais ton ennui
comme une essence d' or sur les pieds de la nuit,
qui te dira jamais qu' à tes côtés, perdue,
mon âme t' adorait pour ta plainte entendue,
et, parmi l' ombre douce et les lilas en fleur,
appuyait, en tremblant, ses lèvres sur ton coeur.",Elegy
7,Henry James Pye,"The War-Elegies Of Tyrtæus, Imitated:  E..","On him shall fame, shall endless glory wait,
Him future ages crown with just applause,
Who boldly daring in the field of fate
Falls a pure victim in his country's cause.
Ah! view yon hapless fugitives who leave
Their seats paternal, and their native sky,
And the full breast in silent sorrow heave
Beneath the galling load of penury.
O'er distant realms who wretched exiles roam,
Perhaps an aged parent's footsteps guide,
Far from their social hearths, and much-loved home,
To meet the taunt of scorn, the frown of pride.
Who wander friendless on a foreign shore,
From foreign hands who ask precarious life,
And prostrate see at Avarice' iron door,
A helpless offspring and a weeping wife.
Thro' hostile regions as they sorrowing go
Tho' pity's bounteous hand afford relief,
In the moist eyelid of the generous foe
Contempt is mingled with the tear of grief.
Far be from us such shame—No! We can die,
Can perish bravely in the glorious strife,
Or guard this hallow'd seat of liberty,
Guard every social charity of life.
Arm youthful warriors! arm! in Britain's right,
Advance, a martial, and a patriot band,
Disdaining pallid fear and shameful flight,
Point the long lance, and lift the shining brand.
Spring ardent to the front, and court the fray,
Nor let the veteran warrior worn with age
Full in the vaward of the bright array
Provoke the war and sink beneath its rage.
The sight unfitting, ill becomes the plain
When bath'd in blood and seam'd with many a wound,
Vent'rous advanced before the youthful train
The venerable fathers press the ground.
But in life's blooming spring the warrior's form
Still charms, tho' fate untimely steal the breath,
Like flowers uprooted by the vernal storm,
In ruin sweet, and beauteous even in death.
While friendship gives the precious balm of praise,
Beauty shall pour her still more precious tear,
A people's voice the hymn of triumph raise,
A people's sorrows sanctify his bier.",Elegy
8,Henry James Pye,"The War-Elegies Of Tyrtæus, Imitated:  E..","Not mine to sing the racer's rapid flight,
Or the athletic wrestler's sinewy force,
Not tho' his limbs are strung with giant might,
His active steps outstrip the whirlwind's course;
Her richest boons tho' lavish fortune shower,
His form tho' faultless, tho' divine his face,
Tho' deck'd in all the pride of regal power,
Tho' eloquence his every accent grace.
Not all the gifts of glory and of fame,
All genius, and all industry can yield,
If the firm bosom feel not valor's flame,
Can form the hero of the martial field.
If while he sees pale slaughter stalk around
And stain with purple gore the dewy plain,
He shrink inglorious from the threaten'd wound,
Nor in the radiant van of war remain.
This is true glory—this the noblest pride,
The brightest trophy blooming youth can wear;
This real merit in a people's eyes,
Before the rest the battle's rage to dare.
Disdaining even the thought of flight or fear,
His life, his soul, by steady valor steel'd,
He calls to glorious death the lagging rear;
Such is the hero of the martial field.
Now rushing on th'embattled foe amain
He turns his scatter'd ranks to shameful flight,
Now throws his eagle eye across the plain,
Guides the loud storm, and rules the waves of fight.
If in the battle's front he press the ground,
His friends, his parents, and his country's pride,
His manly bosom pierced with many a wound,
His snowy vest with purple glory dyed,
The mingled tear of youth and age is shed,
His funeral rites assembled senates grace,
The trophied banner o'er his tomb is spread,
And fame eternal waits his honor'd race.
Ne'er shall his glory fade, his name be lost,
(Tho' dead, his worth, his mem'ry, ne'er shall die,)
Who falls contending with the adverse host
For every public, every social tie.
But should he 'scape the long long sleep of death
What grateful crowds the godlike victor hail,
What strains of conquest sung with rapt'rous breath,
What shouts triumphant float on ev'ry gale.
Him every age and rank, alike revere,
Around his brows perennial laurels bloom,
'Till blest with ease thro' many a rolling year
He sink in silence to the peaceful tomb.
To guard, to grace the veteran, all contend,
Where e'er he goes his presence reverence draws,
To him warm youth, and firmer manhood bend,
And even the hoary senior bows applause.
Such is the fame that crowns th'heroic deed,
Such the reward of those who nobly dare;
Then snatch from glory's hand th'immortal meed,
Nor linger in the manly toil of war.",Elegy
9,Christopher Marlowe,"Elegies, Book One, 5","In summer’s heat and mid-time of the day
To rest my limbs upon a bed I lay,
One window shut, the other open stood,
Which gave such light as twinkles in a wood,
Like twilight glimpse at setting of the sun
Or night being past, and yet not day begun.
Such light to shamefaced maidens must be shown,
Where they may sport, and seem to be unknown.
Then came Corinna in a long loose gown,
Her white neck hid with tresses hanging down:
Resembling fair Semiramis going to bed
Or Laïs of a thousand wooers sped.
I snatched her gown, being thin, the harm was small,
Yet strived she to be covered therewithal.
And striving thus as one that would be cast,
Betrayed herself, and yielded at the last.
Stark naked as she stood before mine eye,
Not one wen in her body could I spy.

What arms and shoulders did I touch and see,
How apt her breasts were to be pressed by me?
How smooth a belly under her waist saw I?
How large a leg, and what a lusty thigh?
To leave the rest, all liked me passing well,
I clinged her naked body, down she fell,
Judge you the rest: being tired she bad me kiss,
Jove send me more such afternoons as this",Elegy
10,Henry James Pye,"The War-Elegies Of Tyrtæus, Imitated:  E..","But ye are Britons—are the sons of those,
Of that unconquer'd race, whose arms of yore,
In many a conflict from superior foes
The bloody wreaths of crimson conquest tore.
Think on the trophies Creci, Poitiers, gave,
Remember Agincourt's illustrious plain;
Remember Blenheim's field, when Danube's wave
Pour'd a red deluge to th'affrighted main.
Heaven frowns not on our cause—and shall the boast
Of impious myriads shake a Briton's soul?—
Rush to the field, and on yon savage host
The awful tempest of the battle roll.
By vengeance stung, and prodigal of life
Advance, nor fear death's universal doom;
Fame's guerdon theirs who fall amid the strife,
The sun of endless glory gilds their tomb.
You well have prov'd each dread extreme of war,
Have felt the ruthless god's terrific ire,
When you have chaced the timid foe afar,
Or ‘measur'd back your ground in faint retire.’
Ye know how few of those who bravely stand
A living bulwark to the croud behind,
And face with dauntless breasts the adverse band,
Have e'er in honor's field their breath resign'd.
But words are weak to paint the foul disgrace,
The scenes of horrid carnage that await
The trembling steps of that unmanly race
Who fly inglorious from the field of fate.
Nor fall they by the brave,—the dastard train
Who fear to meet the thunder of the fight,
Pursue incessant o'er th'ensanguin'd plain
Their weaker foes, and stop their breathless flight.
Ne'er o'er his tomb shall fame her trophy rear,
To him no choral strain the Pæan sounds,
Who sinks beneath the following coward's spear,
His back unseemly gash'd with shameful wounds.
Advance brave youths, a close compacted band,
To check the adverse battle's furious tide;
Now foot to foot in firm-wedged phalanx stand,
‘Now set the teeth, and stretch the nostrils wide.’
March boldly on to meet th'impetuous Gaul,
Pierce with resistless steel his threatening line:
Trust not inglorious to the distant ball,
Bid in his eyes the gleamy bayonet shine.
The white plume nodding o'er the helmed crest
Pour on his squadrons like a wintry flood,
And shocking, horse to horse and breast to breast,
Dye each avenging sword in hostile blood.
'Tis yours ye light arm'd foot, a scatter'd band,
On every side the harrass'd foe to tire,
Aim the destructive tube with skilful hand,
And thin his ranks by well-directed fire.",Elegy
11,Henry James Pye,"The War-Elegies Of Tyrtæus, Imitated:  E..","How long in sloth's inglorious fetters bound
Slumber the brave?—The soft enchantment break.
Britons to arms!—The taunting nations round
Call forth th'ingenuous blush on manhood's cheek.
Calmly ye sit as in the lap of peace,
Tho' loud the din of battle round you roars,
Tho' threat'ning storms on every side encrease,
And the proud Gaul insults your wave-worn shores.
Shake off this torpid gloom—arouse, for shame,
And loose your fury on the barbarous foe;
Full in the radiant front of battle flame,
And even in death the bolt of vengeance throw.
For country, parents, children, blooming wife,
Let the young hero meet the foe elate,
Not fondly anxious for a fleeting life
Fore-doom'd th'inevitable prey of fate.
Grasp the bright sword, and rush to join the fight,
Since none can 'scape th'impartial stroke of death;
Oft from the field the recreant wings his flight
To yield on beds of down his coward breath.
To him a tear his country never gave,
No general grief marks his unhallow'd tomb;
While bending pensive o'er the warrior's grave
A sorrowing nation mourns his timeless doom.
His memory, when dead, by all deplor'd,
His country's guardian, and his kindred's boast:
When living, as a demi-god ador'd,
His breast a fortress, and his arm an host.",Elegy
12,Rob Dyer,From Six Great Barrier Elegies: 5. Toys,"One day, coming down quite early in the morning to the Bay, 
following the sheep track through the toetoe, 
above the pied shags resting in the pohutukawa, 
out to the deep cave, where the dead souls leap
and the fishermen still angle for the sleek maomao, 
I saw a jet fighter buzz the beach, roll round Sugarloaf
in a dizzy spin - noiselessly, only after was his roar; 
I saw a submarine surface silent in the waves, a moving rock, 
beyond Pitokuku, the navel torn by the northerly gale, 
until he dived beyond Palmer's Beach -
a million dollars for a bird to carry our angry arms, 
a million dollars for a shark to lurk unseen.

Yet when the submarine is a tin can rusting away
where the hapuku and the maomao hide, 
when the jet fighter is plaything of the tide and sand, 
like the galleons or grey battleships under the Coral Sea, 
and the pilots all sit home drinking cool beer
and telling tall tales of daring never done, 
the rocks will still stand against the crested waves
for the gannets to perch, the pied shags to rook; 
the petrels too return from fishing the wide oceans
to the secret nesting places of the heart, 
high in Hirakimata, as for ten thousand years -
Will all men's dreams recede from the desolate cliffs?",Elegy

streetlights blur before every dark hour
the plangent drums pause letting the BANG! be heard
and steal my breath away in a whispering murmur
and bring it back flooded with tears of despair

the beast blew sticky breath across your face
so cold my heart had never before been this numb
across latitudes, whirling winds and climbing clouds your soul raced
to report things down here done and undone

now this fervent heart in this world is saved
felled by some silent affray on some unfortunate day
all that's left now are canned poses in many scattered lenses
clinical, aplomb, salient, eminent and innocent

the flamboyance is forever borrowed
like it was yesterday and the day before
as you trudge to your windowless flat
grounded to muse about the good life you led

not even this pandemonium can bring back your pulse
neither sirens nor eulogies can hinder your walking away
the baleful chimes tempered with your longevity before the end of day
and stole you to some adorned world where happiness  is a must

the dazling light of the glimmering sky left your lonely lass
abated, ailed, addled and frohting with disgust
hoping your memory won't be folded and shoved into dark compartments
or your existence be forgotten with the passing of long days and years

in the waiting room you'll  see familiar faces
as they anoint you, welcoming you to the envied life
as they massage your fatigued body in varying paces
and pacify your troubled soul throughout the night

in a few years you'll be turning fossil
torpid, unbecoming of your vlient self
cor blimey! the age is stooping lower and lower! 
like gravity pulling me down from a rooftop of the tallest tower",Elegy

15,Marilyn Hacker,Against Elegies,"James has cancer. Catherine has cancer.
Melvin has AIDS.
Whom will I call, and get no answer?
My old friends, my new friends who are old,
or older, sixty, seventy, take pills
before or after dinner. Arthritis
scourges them. But irremediable night is
farther away from them; they seem to hold
it at bay better than the young-middle-aged
whom something, or another something, kills
before the chapter's finished, the play staged.
The curtains stay down when the light fades.

Morose, unanswerable, the list
of thirty- and forty-year-old suicides
(friends' lovers, friends' daughters) insists
in its lengthening: something's wrong.
The sixty-five-year-olds are splendid, vying
with each other in work-hours and wit.
They bring their generosity along,
setting the tone, or not giving a shit.
How well, or how eccentrically, they dress!
Their anecdotes are to the point, or wide
enough to make room for discrepancies.
But their children are dying.

Natalie died by gas in Montpeyroux.
In San Francisco, Ralph died
of lung cancer, AIDS years later, Lew
wrote to me. Lew, who at forty-five,
expected to be dead of drink, who, ten
years on, wasn't, instead survived
a gentle, bright, impatient younger man.
(Cliché: he falls in love with younger men.)
Natalie's father came, and Natalie,
as if she never had been there, was gone.
Michèle closed up their house (where she
was born). She shrouded every glass inside

— mirrors, photographs — with sheets, as Jews
do, though she's not a Jew.
James knows, he thinks, as much as he wants to.
He's been working half-time since November.
They made the diagnosis in July.
Catherine is back in radiotherapy.
Her schoolboy haircut, prematurely grey,
now frames a face aging with other numbers:
""stage two,' ""stage three"" mean more than ""fifty-one""
and mean, precisely, nothing, which is why
she stares at nothing: lawn chair, stone,
bird, leaf; brusquely turns off the news.

I hope they will be sixty in ten years
and know I used their names
as flares in a polluted atmosphere,
as private reasons where reason obtains
no quarter. Children in the streets
still die in grandfathers' good wars.
Pregnant women with AIDS, schoolgirls, crack whores,
die faster than men do, in more pain,
are more likely than men to die alone.
What are our statistics, when I meet
the lump in my breast, you phone
the doctor to see if your test results came?

The earth-black woman in the bed beside
Lidia on the AIDS floor — deaf and blind:
I want to know if, no, how, she died.
The husband, who'd stopped visiting, returned?
He brought the little boy, those nursery-
school smiles taped on the walls? She traced
her name on Lidia's face
when one of them needed something. She learned
some Braille that week. Most of the time, she slept.
Nobody knew the baby's HIV
status. Sleeping, awake, she wept.
And I left her name behind.

And Lidia, where's she
who got her act so clean
of rum and Salem Filters and cocaine
after her passing husband passed it on?
As soon as she knew
she phoned and told her mother she had AIDS
but no, she wouldn't come back to San Juan.
Sipping café con leche with dessert,
in a blue robe, thick hair in braids,
she beamed: her life was on the right
track, now. But the cysts hurt
too much to sleep through the night.

No one was promised a shapely life
ending in a tutelary vision.
No one was promised: if
you're a genuinely irreplaceable
grandmother or editor
you will not need to be replaced.
When I die, the death I face
will more than likely be illogical:
Alzheimer's or a milk truck: the absurd.
The Talmud teaches we become impure
when we die, profane dirt, once the word
that spoke this life in us has been withdrawn,

the letter taken from the envelope.
If we believe the letter will be read,
some curiosity, some hope
come with knowing that we die.
But this was another century
in which we made death humanly obscene:
Soweto  El Salvador  Kurdistan
Armenia  Shatila  Baghdad  Hanoi
Auschwitz  Each one, unique as our lives are,
taints what's left with complicity,
makes everyone living a survivor
who will, or won't, bear witness for the dead.

I can only bear witness for my own
dead and dying, whom I've often failed:
unanswered letters, unattempted phone
calls, against these fictions. A fiction winds
her watch in sunlight, cancer ticking bone
to shards. A fiction looks
at proofs of a too-hastily finished book
that may be published before he goes blind.
The old, who tell good stories, half expect
that what's written in their chromosomes
will come true, that history won't interject
a virus or a siren or a sealed

train to where age is irrelevant.
The old rebbetzen at Ravensbruck
died in the most wrong place, at the wrong time.
What do the young know different?
No partisans are waiting in the woods
to welcome them. Siblings who stayed home
count down doom. Revolution became
a dinner party in a fast-food chain,
a vendetta for an abscessed crime,
a hard-on market for consumer goods.
A living man reads a dead woman's book.
She wrote it; then, he knows, she was turned in.

For every partisan
there are a million gratuitous
deaths from hunger, all-American
mass murders, small wars,
the old diseases and the new.
Who dies well? The privilege
of asking doesn't have to do with age.
For most of us
no question what our deaths, our lives, mean.
At the end, Catherine will know what she knew,
and James will, and Melvin,
and I, in no one's stories, as we are.",Elegy

17,Rob Dyer,From Six Great Barrier Elegies: 1.  To T..,"We have all at least once, somewhere else, 
died: bloodless, uncertain, wanderers, 
awaiting the judgment of motives -
no, not of deeds - they were judged, also elsewhere -
but why.

Some came to grovel for copper and gold, 
scattering the bones of the native dead.
They fell to the curses of tapu, died poor, 
shot themselves in the Auckland Club, 
or walked off into the mountains alone, became learners, 
while the copper burned the hold timbers, 
the goldships sank, dazzling the puzzled hapuku.

Others brought grass, sheep, rabbits and gorse, 
laying out Cotswold estates: Bampton, King's Mead, 
on Pataua, Kaikoura, Ruahine, Manaia...
burning the bush, topdressing the sacred peaks.
Their soil washed down in the summer rains; 
only the gorse and the rabbits settled the farms; 
the titles were left, the bank took them in the end, 
and the barren clay baked and powdered away.
Did any learn our secret cycle of trees in time, 
searching the deep earth to replenish its loss? 

Some cut the kauri for sailing spars, home beams, 
were surprised they would not grow on demand, 
so planted the pine, last owner of sterile lands
before dustbowl or tundra prevails.
Oh, they the bringers of death, Death's desert, despair! 
where could they turn from damnation? 

Or the procession of learners, my people: 
Heaphy's survey of mountains for sale, despite of owner, 
museum-musty Cheeseman swept by the Alpine gales, 
Elsdon Best prying jumbled tales of savage minds, 
condemned the data for their will to change, 
longed for Eden, place of understanding good and bad, 
here beneath the Southern Cross, as long foretold.
I see them all now, circling the pa-paths
on Sugarloaf, before the angel with the flaming sword.

Gentle Dante, were none to see Beatrice? 
All damned? Or held else forever in Purgatory? Yours? 
********************************************&lt; br&gt;No, some saw her, left Vergil, followed her star: 

Reverend Kendall, his sermons abed, praying
the brown sweating thighs to give them responsion
(Lavinia may be stolen from Turnus by war, be given, 
but the Treaty's not signed till she come freely) , 
was banished by pomp and hypocrisy, clear of the stain.

Young Rex Fairburn, stumbling on the cave
tapu to ancestors even older than his, 
knew at once that only the sacred act of love
within that place could make him pure.

Baxter, drunk or sober with his slingful of words, 
sang psalms in Jerusalem, was forgiven Bathsheba.

Bullmore saw late the hills of his carnal home
as the place of caress, the earth he had mounted, 
the channels of birth, the exuberant breasts.

Lowry, his great heart open to lovers, traitors and poets, 
all who were famished in the seven lean years, 
took his gun, told them to bury him so deep
he might be a great tree in the coming desert, 
a kahikatea or a matai for the little birds, the
whispering angels falling as leaves upon the soil.

18,Rob Dyer,From Six Great Barrier Elegies: 4. On Me..,"Who visits the old tin boatshed, now that the fish are gone? 
the runway broken, in the storm of '69, they say, 
the pulley rusted, one boat done for, the other -
I boot it, feels sound enough, just needs paint and use.
There was once a quay here, traffic of ships and men.
 
But there are no fish in Oruawharo Bay.
The big trawler, bought on Government loan, came by
and cleaned out what there were two weeks ago.
Here Martin of Tours and all the ghosts of unredeemed men
come as tourists to cover their pale skin with summer tan.
What do they care why the shed is derelict? 
'Fish come from fish shops, filleted, headless, gutless.
Who cares how they grow? They must grow somewhere.
How silly! Otherwise we wouldn't have any to eat! '

Up in the rua wharo on the cliff line, staring seaward, 
the old canoe captains rattle their skeletons patiently, 
whispering to each other at night in soft vowels scarce  heard
through the mewing of the petrels cosseted in their bones.
They have foreseen that these proud shades would enter the Bay, 
for the killing of the innocent and the broken tapu.
They have come back from the descent at Te Reinga-o-te-kuku, 
and wait for the cycle to be renewed before they leap
upwards at Whakaaea-a-Rangi on course to Rangiatea.
The tangata porowha came greedy as locusts, tearing the forest, 
ravaging the hills, emptying the seas, with guns as Gift.
They are the rushing people, their words hissing
like storm showers kissing the raupo huts at night.
Tane, Tu, Rongotai wait till the avari-a-Tawhiti pass by, 
the tears of Ranginui are dry, and the sky is blue.
Sooner or later Dukes Guido and Publius, circling the pa-paths
on Sugarloaf, will be settled in Paradise or Hell.
They will ebb like a spring tide after the Easterly dies, 
when the grass is gone like the fish, the butter piles rancid, 
the banks have foreclosed the mortgage, auctioned the shed.
The canoe captains watch the signs, gorse, kikuyu, greenweed, 
and chuckle, for the tapu of Oruawharo will not be broken
forever, the burial grounds will be given back to Tiwakawaka, 
the daughters of Zion return to the marae.

They are very patient, those old sailors.
How else could they sail the far oceans, suspended
between Hawaiki and Aotea like the heart between lovers? 
Still they map the galaxies for the longest voyage, 
when the fish come back and the Matariki shine bright.",Elegy
19,Rob Dyer,From Six Great Barrier Elegies: 6. To A ..,"Oruawharo Bay glistens silver in the nor-west gale, 
the tourists shelter in the lea of Sugarloaf, 
the stranded shags in the pohutukawa; 
only the gannet in dangerous silence fishes the stormwind.
Odysseus on his hillside farm struggles on; 
within it Circe surely waits again, 
the Sirens, Scylla, and Calypso, 
dark, encompassing elements threatening his fall, 
that final cataclysmic day when every female currency
rebels and walks in triumph down Lambton Quay.
Has he not seen their soft voices crying still within? 

How can I, with parables native, like old Lizard Tua's, 
teach Odysseus, rich in gold, silver mined at Oroville, 
rugged from the war he won at Troy, 
no matter how he whips his horse, his farm boys, 
counts his manly deeds against the gorse, 
the dread weakness will creep again at night? 
He will weep again
with pity as he remembers the slaughtered Trojan dead, 
with soft dismay at the old breasts that soothe his dreams, 
devising subtle lures for those who steal his sheep, 
weaving stronger traps to net Penelope, grown bold alone; 
He will whimper
for strong men to cover him with the feathers of their wings, 
and wake to seek his whip to drive his horse, his men.
It is no use, that cowhide thong. They know, his horse and men, 
the secret softness in his blood that drives him on.
They look, as he, for the comfort of a strong man's arms, 
and keep him sacred, humouring anger and obsession, 
lest he, falling on his knees, weep beyond endurance.
They need his seeming strength. Yet when the seeming fails, 
the King must die, for Ithaca to be reborn.

I cannot teach him how else to fail. A poet teaches poetry: 
'Come, Father Odysseus, be my character, join my swift craft; 
let's hitch a ride to the many-headed mountain, Hirakimata, 
climb the Forestry trails, pouring hot tears -
at least they'll keep the bush springs warm -
man cannot live as man, alone, transcendent, -
then walk down to some neighbour state, Port Fitzroy or Okiwi, 
and tell tall tales how on Hirakimata's bloodstrewn side
you subdued Circe
avoided Sirens
escaped Scylla
survived Calypso.
They will do us homage as if we were real heroes, 
you and me, crusty old tellers of new myths, 
feathered by the winged words of our sayings, 
purring like torn old tomcats on a spinster's knee.'

20,Rob Dyer,From Six Great Barrier Elegies: 2. The G..,"Once in our clematis days your hooflets trampled tamariki-a-Tane: 
rimu, totara, miro, ti, kahikatea, nikau, 
startling the tui from the kowhai, the ruru in the kauri.
Then the settler's wife, lingering in the tin privy after tea, 
called you Celeste, a fantasy of starlight in the twilight bush.

Now you are worn, as she, used by the steep slopes.
You have hauled away the bush as logs, 
wrenched away the stumps for your shouting masters, 
spread phosphates for the unacclimatised grass, 
herded the senseless sheep to British markets.
Tane no longer comes here, the ruru or tui, 
only the settlers' children, seeing land as currency.
It is too late for kindness to cherish this land or you.
You have felt the beat of your riders, know
they never settled these temporary places: 
Tryphena, Oroville, Fitzroy, Claris.
Shocked you rear from the gentling touch, 
distrustful as of a calm day on the eroded slopes.
It too will pass, and the sharp wind and rain return
to scratch the topsoil away, like a tiger clawing
his prey, a greedy farmer lashing his beast.
You are proud you have broken this virgin soil; 
unpitied and without pity, the land is your product.
And yet you wait, as layer by layer the loam is used, 
for the bones of the buried rock to surface, 
red and useless to those who profit from your land.

One day in the cicada summer, when the last settler has gone, 
and the wind loosens the pitiless clay, your sister, 
Papa-tu-a-nuku will take you back to herself, 
weary of bearing from the dark those lovers
who for bankers on Queen Street wrought this ruin.
You will rise, your old bones aching, 
and dance again the wave-swept swirl of your freedom, 
galloping, galloping on, till the grey hide blends
in the eddies of red dust, and longed-for silence
buries your heart in the arid island hills, 
the lover who never spoke within the beloved land.",Elegy
