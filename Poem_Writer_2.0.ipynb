      "That this can scarce be right!  We are not peers\r\n",
      "So to be lovers; and I own, and grieve,\r\n",
      "That givers of such gifts as mine are, must\r\n",
      "Be counted with the ungenerous.  Out, alas!\r\n",
      "I will not soil thy purple with my dust,\r\n",
      "Nor breathe my poison on thy Venice-glass,\r\n",
      "Nor give thee any love—which were unjust.\r\n",
      "Beloved, I only love thee! let it pass.\n",
      "Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed\r\n",
      "And worthy of acceptation.  Fire is bright,\r\n",
      "Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light\r\n",
      "Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:\r\n",
      "And love is fire.  And when I say at need\r\n",
      "I love thee . . . mark! . . . I love thee—in thy sight\r\n",
      "I stand transfigured, glorified aright,\r\n",
      "With conscience of the new rays that proceed\r\n",
      "Out of my face toward thine.  There’s nothing low\r\n",
      "In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures\r\n",
      "Who love God, God accepts while loving so.\r\n",
      "And what I feel, across the inferior features\r\n",
      "Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show\r\n",
      "How that great work of Love enhances Nature’s.\n",
      "And therefore if to love can be desert,\r\n",
      "I am not all unworthy.  Cheeks as pale\r\n",
      "As these you see, and trembling knees that fail\r\n",
      "To bear the burden of a heavy heart,—\r\n",
      "This weary minstrel-life that once was girt\r\n",
      "To climb Aornus, and can scarce avail\r\n",
      "To pipe now ’gainst the valley nightingale\r\n",
      "A melancholy music,—why advert\r\n",
      "To these things?  O Belovëd, it is plain\r\n",
      "I am not of thy worth nor for thy place!\r\n",
      "And yet, because I love thee, I obtain\r\n",
      "From that same love this vindicating grace\r\n",
      "To live on still in love, and yet in vain,—\r\n",
      "To bless thee, yet renounce thee to thy face.\n",
      "Indeed this very love which is my boast,\r\n",
      "And which, when rising up from breast to brow,\r\n",
      "Doth crown me with a ruby large enow\r\n",
      "To draw men’s eyes and prove the inner cost,—\r\n",
      "This love even, all my worth, to the uttermost,\r\n",
      "I should not love withal, unless that thou\r\n",
      "Hadst set me an example, shown me how,\r\n",
      "When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed,\r\n",
      "And love called love.  And thus, I cannot speak\r\n",
      "Of love even, as a good thing of my own:\r\n",
      "Thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak,\r\n",
      "And placed it by thee on a golden throne,—\r\n",
      "And that I love (O soul, we must be meek!)\r\n",
      "Is by thee only, whom I love alone.\n",
      "And wilt thou have me fashion into speech\r\n",
      "The love I bear thee, finding words enough,\r\n",
      "And hold the torch out, while the winds are rough,\r\n",
      "Between our faces, to cast light on each?—\r\n",
      "I drop it at thy feet.  I cannot teach\r\n",
      "My hand to hold my spirits so far off\r\n",
      "From myself—me—that I should bring thee proof\r\n",
      "In words, of love hid in me out of reach.\r\n",
      "Nay, let the silence of my womanhood\r\n",
      "Commend my woman-love to thy belief,—\r\n",
      "Seeing that I stand unwon, however wooed,\r\n",
      "And rend the garment of my life, in brief,\r\n",
      "By a most dauntless, voiceless fortitude,\r\n",
      "Lest one touch of this heart convey its grief.\n",
      "If thou must love me, let it be for nought\r\n",
      "Except for love’s sake only.  Do not say\r\n",
      "“I love her for her smile—her look—her way\r\n",
      "Of speaking gently,—for a trick of thought\r\n",
      "That falls in well with mine, and certes brought\r\n",
      "A sense of pleasant ease on such a day”—\r\n",
      "For these things in themselves, Belovëd, may\r\n",
      "Be changed, or change for thee,—and love, so wrought,\r\n",
      "May be unwrought so.  Neither love me for\r\n",
      "Thine own dear pity’s wiping my cheeks dry,—\r\n",
      "A creature might forget to weep, who bore\r\n",
      "Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!\r\n",
      "But love me for love’s sake, that evermore\r\n",
      "Thou may’st love on, through love’s eternity.\n",
      "Accuse me not, beseech thee, that I wear\r\n",
      "Too calm and sad a face in front of thine;\r\n",
      "For we two look two ways, and cannot shine\r\n",
      "With the same sunlight on our brow and hair.\r\n",
      "On me thou lookest with no doubting care,\r\n",
      "As on a bee shut in a crystalline;\r\n",
      "Since sorrow hath shut me safe in love’s divine,\r\n",
      "And to spread wing and fly in the outer air\r\n",
      "Were most impossible failure, if I strove\r\n",
      "To fail so.  But I look on thee—on thee—\r\n",
      "Beholding, besides love, the end of love,\r\n",
      "Hearing oblivion beyond memory;\r\n",
      "As one who sits and gazes from above,\r\n",
      "Over the rivers to the bitter sea.\n",
      "And yet, because thou overcomest so,\r\n",
      "Because thou art more noble and like a king,\r\n",
      "Thou canst prevail against my fears and fling\r\n",
      "Thy purple round me, till my heart shall grow\r\n",
      "Too close against thine heart henceforth to know\r\n",
      "How it shook when alone.  Why, conquering\r\n",
      "May prove as lordly and complete a thing\r\n",
      "In lifting upward, as in crushing low!\r\n",
      "And as a vanquished soldier yields his sword\r\n",
      "To one who lifts him from the bloody earth,\r\n",
      "Even so, Belovëd, I at last record,\r\n",
      "Here ends my strife.  If thou invite me forth,\r\n",
      "I rise above abasement at the word.\r\n",
      "Make thy love larger to enlarge my worth!\n",
      "My poet, thou canst touch on all the notes\r\n",
      "God set between His After and Before,\r\n",
      "And strike up and strike off the general roar\r\n",
      "Of the rushing worlds a melody that floats\r\n",
      "In a serene air purely.  Antidotes\r\n",
      "Of medicated music, answering for\r\n",
      "Mankind’s forlornest uses, thou canst pour\r\n",
      "From thence into their ears.  God’s will devotes\r\n",
      "Thine to such ends, and mine to wait on thine.\r\n",
      "How, Dearest, wilt thou have me for most use?\r\n",
      "A hope, to sing by gladly? or a fine\r\n",
      "Sad memory, with thy songs to interfuse?\r\n",
      "A shade, in which to sing—of palm or pine?\r\n",
      "A grave, on which to rest from singing?  Choose.\n",
      "I never gave a lock of hair away\r\n",
      "To a man, Dearest, except this to thee,\r\n",
      "Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully\r\n",
      "I ring out to the full brown length and say\r\n",
      "“Take it.”  My day of youth went yesterday;\r\n",
      "My hair no longer bounds to my foot’s glee,\r\n",
      "Nor plant I it from rose- or myrtle-tree,\r\n",
      "As girls do, any more: it only may\r\n",
      "Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,\r\n",
      "Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside\r\n",
      "Through sorrow’s trick.  I thought the\r\n",
      "funeral-shears\r\n",
      "Would take this first, but Love is justified,—\r\n",
      "Take it thou,—finding pure, from all those years,\r\n",
      "The kiss my mother left here when she died.\n",
      "The soul’s Rialto hath its\r\n",
      "merchandize;\r\n",
      "I barter curl for curl upon that mart,\r\n",
      "And from my poet’s forehead to my heart\r\n",
      "Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,—\r\n",
      "As purply black, as erst to Pindar’s eyes\r\n",
      "The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart\r\n",
      "The nine white Muse-brows.  For this counterpart, . . .\r\n",
      "The bay crown’s shade, Belovëd, I surmise,\r\n",
      "Still lingers on thy curl, it is so black!\r\n",
      "Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath,\r\n",
      "I tie the shadows safe from gliding back,\r\n",
      "And lay the gift where nothing hindereth;\r\n",
      "Here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack\r\n",
      "No natural heat till mine grows cold in death.\n",
      "Belovëd, my Belovëd, when I think\r\n",
      "That thou wast in the world a year ago,\r\n",
      "What time I sat alone here in the snow\r\n",
      "And saw no footprint, heard the silence sink\r\n",
      "No moment at thy voice, but, link by link,\r\n",
      "Went counting all my chains as if that so\r\n",
      "They never could fall off at any blow\r\n",
      "Struck by thy possible hand,—why, thus I drink\r\n",
      "Of life’s great cup of wonder!  Wonderful,\r\n",
      "Never to feel thee thrill the day or night\r\n",
      "With personal act or speech,—nor ever cull\r\n",
      "Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white\r\n",
      "Thou sawest growing!  Atheists are as dull,\r\n",
      "Who cannot guess God’s presence out of sight.\n",
      "Say over again, and yet once over again,\r\n",
      "That thou dost love me.  Though the word repeated\r\n",
      "Should seem a “cuckoo-song,” as thou dost treat\r\n",
      "it,\r\n",
      "Remember, never to the hill or plain,\r\n",
      "Valley and wood, without her cuckoo-strain\r\n",
      "Comes the fresh Spring in all her green completed.\r\n",
      "Belovëd, I, amid the darkness greeted\r\n",
      "By a doubtful spirit-voice, in that doubt’s pain\r\n",
      "Cry, “Speak once more—thou lovest!”  Who\r\n",
      "can fear\r\n",
      "Too many stars, though each in heaven shall roll,\r\n",
      "Too many flowers, though each shall crown the year?\r\n",
      "Say thou dost love me, love me, love me—toll\r\n",
      "The silver iterance!—only minding, Dear,\r\n",
      "To love me also in silence with thy soul.\n",
      "When our two souls stand up erect and\r\n",
      "strong,\r\n",
      "Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,\r\n",
      "Until the lengthening wings break into fire\r\n",
      "At either curvëd point,—what bitter wrong\r\n",
      "Can the earth do to us, that we should not long\r\n",
      "Be here contented?  Think!  In mounting higher,\r\n",
      "The angels would press on us and aspire\r\n",
      "To drop some golden orb of perfect song\r\n",
      "Into our deep, dear silence.  Let us stay\r\n",
      "Rather on earth, Belovëd,—where the unfit\r\n",
      "Contrarious moods of men recoil away\r\n",
      "And isolate pure spirits, and permit\r\n",
      "A place to stand and love in for a day,\r\n",
      "With darkness and the death-hour rounding it.\n",
      "Is it indeed so?  If I lay here dead,\r\n",
      "Wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine?\r\n",
      "And would the sun for thee more coldly shine\r\n",
      "Because of grave-damps falling round my head?\r\n",
      "I marvelled, my Belovëd, when I read\r\n",
      "Thy thought so in the letter.  I am thine—\r\n",
      "But . . . so much to thee?  Can I pour thy wine\r\n",
      "While my hands tremble?  Then my soul, instead\r\n",
      "Of dreams of death, resumes life’s lower range.\r\n",
      "Then, love me, Love! look on me—breathe on me!\r\n",
      "As brighter ladies do not count it strange,\r\n",
      "For love, to give up acres and degree,\r\n",
      "I yield the grave for thy sake, and exchange\r\n",
      "My near sweet view of heaven, for earth with thee!\n",
      "Let the world’s sharpness like a clasping\r\n",
      "knife\r\n",
      "Shut in upon itself and do no harm\r\n",
      "In this close hand of Love, now soft and warm,\r\n",
      "And let us hear no sound of human strife\r\n",
      "After the click of the shutting.  Life to life—\r\n",
      "I lean upon thee, Dear, without alarm,\r\n",
      "And feel as safe as guarded by a charm\r\n",
      "Against the stab of worldlings, who if rife\r\n",
      "Are weak to injure.  Very whitely still\r\n",
      "The lilies of our lives may reassure\r\n",
      "Their blossoms from their roots, accessible\r\n",
      "Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer;\r\n",
      "Growing straight, out of man’s reach, on the hill.\r\n",
      "God only, who made us rich, can make us poor.\n",
      "A heavy heart, Belovëd, have I borne\r\n",
      "From year to year until I saw thy face,\r\n",
      "And sorrow after sorrow took the place\r\n",
      "Of all those natural joys as lightly worn\r\n",
      "As the stringed pearls, each lifted in its turn\r\n",
      "By a beating heart at dance-time.  Hopes apace\r\n",
      "Were changed to long despairs, till God’s own grace\r\n",
      "Could scarcely lift above the world forlorn\r\n",
      "My heavy heart.  Then thou didst bid me bring\r\n",
      "And let it drop adown thy calmly great\r\n",
      "Deep being!  Fast it sinketh, as a thing\r\n",
      "Which its own nature does precipitate,\r\n",
      "While thine doth close above it, mediating\r\n",
      "Betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate.\n",
      "I lived with visions for my company\r\n",
      "Instead of men and women, years ago,\r\n",
      "And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know\r\n",
      "A sweeter music than they played to me.\r\n",
      "But soon their trailing purple was not free\r\n",
      "Of this world’s dust, their lutes did silent grow,\r\n",
      "And I myself grew faint and blind below\r\n",
      "Their vanishing eyes.  Then thou didst come—to be,\r\n",
      "Belovëd, what they seemed.  Their shining fronts,\r\n",
      "Their songs, their splendours, (better, yet the same,\r\n",
      "As river-water hallowed into fonts)\r\n",
      "Met in thee, and from out thee overcame\r\n",
      "My soul with satisfaction of all wants:\r\n",
      "Because God’s gifts put man’s best dreams to\r\n",
      "shame.\n",
      "My own Belovëd, who hast lifted me\r\n",
      "From this drear flat of earth where I was thrown,\r\n",
      "And, in betwixt the languid ringlets, blown\r\n",
      "A life-breath, till the forehead hopefully\r\n",
      "Shines out again, as all the angels see,\r\n",
      "Before thy saving kiss!  My own, my own,\r\n",
      "Who camest to me when the world was gone,\r\n",
      "And I who looked for only God, found thee!\r\n",
      "I find thee; I am safe, and strong, and glad.\r\n",
      "As one who stands in dewless asphodel,\r\n",
      "Looks backward on the tedious time he had\r\n",
      "In the upper life,—so I, with bosom-swell,\r\n",
      "Make witness, here, between the good and bad,\r\n",
      "That Love, as strong as Death, retrieves as well.\n",
      "My letters! all dead paper, mute and white!\r\n",
      "And yet they seem alive and quivering\r\n",
      "Against my tremulous hands which loose the string\r\n",
      "And let them drop down on my knee to-night.\r\n",
      "This said,—he wished to have me in his sight\r\n",
      "Once, as a friend: this fixed a day in spring\r\n",
      "To come and touch my hand . . . a simple thing,\r\n",
      "Yet I wept for it!—this, . . . the paper’s light . .\r\n",
      ".\r\n",
      "Said, Dear I love thee; and I sank and quailed\r\n",
      "As if God’s future thundered on my past.\r\n",
      "This said, I am thine—and so its ink has paled\r\n",
      "With lying at my heart that beat too fast.\r\n",
      "And this . . . O Love, thy words have ill availed\r\n",
      "If, what this said, I dared repeat at last!\n",
      "I think of thee!—my thoughts do twine and\r\n",
      "bud\r\n",
      "About thee, as wild vines, about a tree,\r\n",
      "Put out broad leaves, and soon there’s nought to see\r\n",
      "Except the straggling green which hides the wood.\r\n",
      "Yet, O my palm-tree, be it understood\r\n",
      "I will not have my thoughts instead of thee\r\n",
      "Who art dearer, better!  Rather, instantly\r\n",
      "Renew thy presence; as a strong tree should,\r\n",
      "Rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare,\r\n",
      "And let these bands of greenery which insphere thee,\r\n",
      "Drop heavily down,—burst, shattered everywhere!\r\n",
      "Because, in this deep joy to see and hear thee\r\n",
      "And breathe within thy shadow a new air,\r\n",
      "I do not think of thee—I am too near thee.\n",
      "I see thine image through my tears to-night,\r\n",
      "And yet to-day I saw thee smiling.  How\r\n",
      "Refer the cause?—Belovëd, is it thou\r\n",
      "Or I, who makes me sad?  The acolyte\r\n",
      "Amid the chanted joy and thankful rite\r\n",
      "May so fall flat, with pale insensate brow,\r\n",
      "On the altar-stair.  I hear thy voice and vow,\r\n",
      "Perplexed, uncertain, since thou art out of sight,\r\n",
      "As he, in his swooning ears, the choir’s amen.\r\n",
      "Belovëd, dost thou love? or did I see all\r\n",
      "The glory as I dreamed, and fainted when\r\n",
      "Too vehement light dilated my ideal,\r\n",
      "For my soul’s eyes?  Will that light come again,\r\n",
      "As now these tears come—falling hot and real?\n",
      "Thou comest! all is said without a word.\r\n",
      "I sit beneath thy looks, as children do\r\n",
      "In the noon-sun, with souls that tremble through\r\n",
      "Their happy eyelids from an unaverred\r\n",
      "Yet prodigal inward joy.  Behold, I erred\r\n",
      "In that last doubt! and yet I cannot rue\r\n",
      "The sin most, but the occasion—that we two\r\n",
      "Should for a moment stand unministered\r\n",
      "By a mutual presence.  Ah, keep near and close,\r\n",
      "Thou dove-like help! and when my fears would rise,\r\n",
      "With thy broad heart serenely interpose:\r\n",
      "Brood down with thy divine sufficiencies\r\n",
      "These thoughts which tremble when bereft of those,\r\n",
      "Like callow birds left desert to the skies.\n",
      "The first time that the sun rose on thine\r\n",
      "oath\r\n",
      "To love me, I looked forward to the moon\r\n",
      "To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon\r\n",
      "And quickly tied to make a lasting troth.\r\n",
      "Quick-loving hearts, I thought, may quickly loathe;\r\n",
      "And, looking on myself, I seemed not one\r\n",
      "For such man’s love!—more like an out-of-tune\r\n",
      "Worn viol, a good singer would be wroth\r\n",
      "To spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste,\r\n",
      "Is laid down at the first ill-sounding note.\r\n",
      "I did not wrong myself so, but I placed\r\n",
      "A wrong on thee.  For perfect strains may float\r\n",
      "’Neath master-hands, from instruments defaced,—\r\n",
      "And great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat.\n",
      "Yes, call me by my pet-name! let me hear\r\n",
      "The name I used to run at, when a child,\r\n",
      "From innocent play, and leave the cowslips plied,\r\n",
      "To glance up in some face that proved me dear\r\n",
      "With the look of its eyes.  I miss the clear\r\n",
      "Fond voices which, being drawn and reconciled\r\n",
      "Into the music of Heaven’s undefiled,\r\n",
      "Call me no longer.  Silence on the bier,\r\n",
      "While I call God—call God!—so let thy mouth\r\n",
      "Be heir to those who are now exanimate.\r\n",
      "Gather the north flowers to complete the south,\r\n",
      "And catch the early love up in the late.\r\n",
      "Yes, call me by that name,—and I, in truth,\r\n",
      "With the same heart, will answer and not wait.\n",
      "With the same heart, I said, I’ll answer\r\n",
