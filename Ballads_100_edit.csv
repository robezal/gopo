0,Edgar Allan Poe,Bridal Ballad,"The ring is on my hand,
         And the wreath is on my brow;
       Satin and jewels grand
       Are all at my command,
         And I am happy now.

       And my lord he loves me well;
         But, when first he breathed his vow,
       I felt my bosom swell-
       For the words rang as a knell,
       And the voice seemed his who fell
       In the battle down the dell,
         And who is happy now.

       But he spoke to re-assure me,
         And he kissed my pallid brow,
       While a reverie came o'er me,
       And to the church-yard bore me,
       And I sighed to him before me,
       Thinking him dead D'Elormie,
       ""Oh, I am happy now!""

       And thus the words were spoken,
         And this the plighted vow,
       And, though my faith be broken,
       And, though my heart be broken,
       Here is a ring, as token
         That I am happy now!

       Would God I could awaken!
         For I dream I know not how!
       And my soul is sorely shaken
       Lest an evil step be taken,-
       Lest the dead who is forsaken
         May not be happy now.",Ballad
1,Federico Garc√≠a Lorca,Ballad Of The Moon,"translated by Will Kirkland

The moon came into the forge
in her bustle of flowering nard.
The little boy stares at her, stares.
The boy is staring hard.
In the shaken air
the moon moves her amrs,
and shows lubricious and pure,
her breasts of hard tin.
""Moon, moon, moon, run!
If the gypsies come,
they will use your heart
to make white necklaces and rings.""
""Let me dance, my little one.
When the gypsies come,
they'll find you on the anvil
with your lively eyes closed tight.
""Moon, moon, moon, run!
I can feelheir horses come.""
""Let me be, my little one,
don't step on me, all starched and white!""

Closer comes the the horseman,
drumming on the plain.
The boy is in the forge;
his eyes are closed.
Through the olive grove
come the gypsies, dream and bronze,
their heads held high,
their hooded eyes.

Oh, how the night owl calls,
calling, calling from its tree!
The moon is climbing through the sky
with the child by the hand.

They are crying in the forge,
all the gypsies, shouting, crying.
The air is veiwing all, views all.
The air is at the viewing.",Ballad
2,Gwendolyn Brooks,The Sonnet-Ballad,"Oh mother, mother, where is happiness?
They took my lover's tallness off to war,
Left me lamenting. Now I cannot guess
What I can use an empty heart-cup for.
He won't be coming back here any more.
Some day the war will end, but, oh, I knew
When he went walking grandly out that door
That my sweet love would have to be untrue.
Would have to be untrue. Would have to court
Coquettish death, whose impudent and strange
Possessive arms and beauty (of a sort)
Can make a hard man hesitate--and change.
And he will be the one to stammer, ""Yes.""
Oh mother, mother, where is happiness?",Ballad
3,Oscar Wilde,The Ballad Of Reading Gaol,"(In memoriam
C. T. W.
Sometime trooper of the Royal Horse Guards
obiit H.M. prison, Reading, Berkshire
July 7, 1896)

I

He did not wear his scarlet coat,
For blood and wine are red,
And blood and wine were on his hands
When they found him with the dead,
The poor dead woman whom he loved,
And murdered in her bed.

He walked amongst the Trial Men
In a suit of shabby grey;
A cricket cap was on his head,
And his step seemed light and gay;
But I never saw a man who looked
So wistfully at the day.

I never saw a man who looked
With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
Which prisoners call the sky,
And at every drifting cloud that went
With sails of silver by.

I walked, with other souls in pain,
Within another ring,
And was wondering if the man had done
A great or little thing,
When a voice behind me whispered low,
'THAT FELLOW'S GOT TO SWING.'

Dear Christ! the very prison walls
Suddenly seemed to reel,
And the sky above my head became
Like a casque of scorching steel;
And, though I was a soul in pain,
My pain I could not feel.

I only knew what hunted thought
Quickened his step, and why
He looked upon the garish day
With such a wistful eye;
The man had killed the thing he loved,
And so he had to die.


Yet each man kills the thing he loves,
By each let this be heard,
Some do it with a bitter look,
Some with a flattering word,
The coward does it with a kiss,
The brave man with a sword!

Some kill their love when they are young,
And some when they are old;
Some strangle with the hands of Lust,
Some with the hands of Gold:
The kindest use a knife, because
The dead so soon grow cold.

Some love too little, some too long,
Some sell, and others buy;
Some do the deed with many tears,
And some without a sigh:
For each man kills the thing he loves,
Yet each man does not die.

He does not die a death of shame
On a day of dark disgrace,
Nor have a noose about his neck,
Nor a cloth upon his face,
Nor drop feet foremost through the floor
Into an empty space.


He does not sit with silent men
Who watch him night and day;
Who watch him when he tries to weep,
And when he tries to pray;
Who watch him lest himself should rob
The prison of its prey.

He does not wake at dawn to see
Dread figures throng his room,
The shivering Chaplain robed in white,
The Sheriff stern with gloom,
And the Governor all in shiny black,
With the yellow face of Doom.

He does not rise in piteous haste
To put on convict-clothes,
While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats,
and notes
Each new and nerve-twitched pose,
Fingering a watch whose little ticks
Are like horrible hammer-blows.

He does not know that sickening thirst
That sands one's throat, before
The hangman with his gardener's gloves
Slips through the padded door,
And binds one with three leathern thongs,
That the throat may thirst no more.

He does not bend his head to hear
The Burial Office read,
Nor, while the terror of his soul
Tells him he is not dead,
Cross his own coffin, as he moves
Into the hideous shed.

He does not stare upon the air
Through a little roof of glass:
He does not pray with lips of clay
For his agony to pass;
Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek
The kiss of Caiaphas.


II


Six weeks our guardsman walked the yard,
In the suit of shabby grey:
His cricket cap was on his head,
And his step seemed light and gay,
But I never saw a man who looked
So wistfully at the day.

I never saw a man who looked
With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
Which prisoners call the sky,
And at every wandering cloud that trailed
Its ravelled fleeces by.

He did not wring his hands, as do
Those witless men who dare
To try to rear the changeling Hope
In the cave of black Despair:
He only looked upon the sun,
And drank the morning air.

He did not wring his hands nor weep,
Nor did he peek or pine,
But he drank the air as though it held
Some healthful anodyne;
With open mouth he drank the sun
As though it had been wine!

And I and all the souls in pain,
Who tramped the other ring,
Forgot if we ourselves had done
A great or little thing,
And watched with gaze of dull amaze
The man who had to swing.

And strange it was to see him pass
With a step so light and gay,
And strange it was to see him look
So wistfully at the day,
And strange it was to think that he
Had such a debt to pay.


For oak and elm have pleasant leaves
That in the springtime shoot:
But grim to see is the gallows-tree,
With its adder-bitten root,
And, green or dry, a man must die
Before it bears its fruit!

The loftiest place is that seat of grace
For which all worldlings try:
But who would stand in hempen band
Upon a scaffold high,
And through a murderer's collar take
His last look at the sky?

It is sweet to dance to violins
When Love and Life are fair:
To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes
Is delicate and rare:
But it is not sweet with nimble feet
To dance upon the air!

So with curious eyes and sick surmise
We watched him day by day,
And wondered if each one of us
Would end the self-same way,
For none can tell to what red Hell
His sightless soul may stray.

At last the dead man walked no more
Amongst the Trial Men,
And I knew that he was standing up
In the black dock's dreadful pen,
And that never would I see his face
In God's sweet world again.

Like two doomed ships that pass in storm
We had crossed each other's way:
But we made no sign, we said no word,
We had no word to say;
For we did not meet in the holy night,
But in the shameful day.

A prison wall was round us both,
Two outcast men we were:
The world had thrust us from its heart,
And God from out His care:
And the iron gin that waits for Sin
Had caught us in its snare.


III


In Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,
And the dripping wall is high,
So it was there he took the air
Beneath the leaden sky,
And by each side a Warder walked,
For fear the man might die.

Or else he sat with those who watched
His anguish night and day;
Who watched him when he rose to weep,
And when he crouched to pray;
Who watched him lest himself should rob
Their scaffold of its prey.

The Governor was strong upon
The Regulations Act:
The Doctor said that Death was but
A scientific fact:
And twice a day the Chaplain called,
And left a little tract.

And twice a day he smoked his pipe,
And drank his quart of beer:
His soul was resolute, and held
No hiding-place for fear;
He often said that he was glad
The hangman's hands were near.

But why he said so strange a thing
No Warder dared to ask:
For he to whom a watcher's doom
Is given as his task,
Must set a lock upon his lips,
And make his face a mask.

Or else he might be moved, and try
To comfort or console:
And what should Human Pity do
Pent up in Murderers' Hole?
What word of grace in such a place
Could help a brother's soul?


With slouch and swing around the ring
We trod the Fools' Parade!
We did not care: we knew we were
The Devil's Own Brigade:
And shaven head and feet of lead
Make a merry masquerade.

We tore the tarry rope to shreds
With blunt and bleeding nails;
We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,
And cleaned the shining rails:
And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,
And clattered with the pails.

We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,
We turned the dusty drill:
We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,
And sweated on the mill:
But in the heart of every man
Terror was lying still.

So still it lay that every day
Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:
And we forgot the bitter lot
That waits for fool and knave,
Till once, as we tramped in from work,
We passed an open grave.

With yawning mouth the yellow hole
Gaped for a living thing;
The very mud cried out for blood
To the thirsty asphalte ring:
And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair
Some prisoner had to swing.

Right in we went, with soul intent
On Death and Dread and Doom:
The hangman, with his little bag,
Went shuffling through the gloom:
And each man trembled as he crept
Into his numbered tomb.


That night the empty corridors
Were full of forms of Fear,
And up and down the iron town
Stole feet we could not hear,
And through the bars that hide the stars
White faces seemed to peer.

He lay as one who lies and dreams
In a pleasant meadow-land,
The watchers watched him as he slept,
And could not understand
How one could sleep so sweet a sleep
With a hangman close at hand.

But there is no sleep when men must weep
Who never yet have wept:
So we - the fool, the fraud, the knave -
That endless vigil kept,
And through each brain on hands of pain
Another's terror crept.

Alas! it is a fearful thing
To feel another's guilt!
For, right within, the sword of Sin
Pierced to its poisoned hilt,
And as molten lead were the tears we shed
For the blood we had not spilt.

The Warders with their shoes of felt
Crept by each padlocked door,
And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,
Grey figures on the floor,
And wondered why men knelt to pray
Who never prayed before.

All through the night we knelt and prayed,
Mad mourners of a corse!
The troubled plumes of midnight were
The plumes upon a hearse:
And bitter wine upon a sponge
Was the savour of Remorse.


The grey cock crew, the red cock crew,
But never came the day:
And crooked shapes of Terror crouched,
In the corners where we lay:
And each evil sprite that walks by night
Before us seemed to play.

They glided past, they glided fast,
Like travellers through a mist:
They mocked the moon in a rigadoon
Of delicate turn and twist,
And with formal pace and loathsome grace
The phantoms kept their tryst.

With mop and mow, we saw them go,
Slim shadows hand in hand:
About, about, in ghostly rout
They trod a saraband:
And the damned grotesques made arabesques,
Like the wind upon the sand!

With the pirouettes of marionettes,
They tripped on pointed tread:
But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,
As their grisly masque they led,
And loud they sang, and long they sang,
For they sang to wake the dead.

'Oho!' they cried, 'The world is wide,
But fettered limbs go lame!
And once, or twice, to throw the dice
Is a gentlemanly game,
But he does not win who plays with Sin
In the secret House of Shame.'

No things of air these antics were,
That frolicked with such glee:
To men whose lives were held in gyves,
And whose feet might not go free,
Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,
Most terrible to see.

Around, around, they waltzed and wound;
Some wheeled in smirking pairs;
With the mincing step of a demirep
Some sidled up the stairs:
And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,
Each helped us at our prayers.

The morning wind began to moan,
But still the night went on:
Through its giant loom the web of gloom
Crept till each thread was spun:
And, as we prayed, we grew afraid
Of the Justice of the Sun.

The moaning wind went wandering round
The weeping prison-wall:
Till like a wheel of turning steel
We felt the minutes crawl:
O moaning wind! what had we done
To have such a seneschal?

At last I saw the shadowed bars,
Like a lattice wrought in lead,
Move right across the whitewashed wall
That faced my three-plank bed,
And I knew that somewhere in the world
God's dreadful dawn was red.

At six o'clock we cleaned our cells,
At seven all was still,
But the sough and swing of a mighty wing
The prison seemed to fill,
For the Lord of Death with icy breath
Had entered in to kill.

He did not pass in purple pomp,
Nor ride a moon-white steed.
Three yards of cord and a sliding board
Are all the gallows' need:
So with rope of shame the Herald came
To do the secret deed.

We were as men who through a fen
Of filthy darkness grope:
We did not dare to breathe a prayer,
Or to give our anguish scope:
Something was dead in each of us,
And what was dead was Hope.

For Man's grim Justice goes its way,
And will not swerve aside:
It slays the weak, it slays the strong,
It has a deadly stride:
With iron heel it slays the strong,
The monstrous parricide!

We waited for the stroke of eight:
Each tongue was thick with thirst:
For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate
That makes a man accursed,
And Fate will use a running noose
For the best man and the worst.

We had no other thing to do,
Save to wait for the sign to come:
So, like things of stone in a valley lone,
Quiet we sat and dumb:
But each man's heart beat thick and quick,
Like a madman on a drum!

With sudden shock the prison-clock
Smote on the shivering air,
And from all the gaol rose up a wail
Of impotent despair,
Like the sound that frightened marshes hear
From some leper in his lair.

And as one sees most fearful things
In the crystal of a dream,
We saw the greasy hempen rope
Hooked to the blackened beam,
And heard the prayer the hangman's snare
Strangled into a scream.

And all the woe that moved him so
That he gave that bitter cry,
And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,
None knew so well as I:
For he who lives more lives than one
More deaths than one must die.


IV


There is no chapel on the day
On which they hang a man:
The Chaplain's heart is far too sick,
Or his face is far too wan,
Or there is that written in his eyes
Which none should look upon.

So they kept us close till nigh on noon,
And then they rang the bell,
And the Warders with their jingling keys
Opened each listening cell,
And down the iron stair we tramped,
Each from his separate Hell.

Out into God's sweet air we went,
But not in wonted way,
For this man's face was white with fear,
And that man's face was grey,
And I never saw sad men who looked
So wistfully at the day.

I never saw sad men who looked
With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
We prisoners called the sky,
And at every careless cloud that passed
In happy freedom by.

But there were those amongst us all
Who walked with downcast head,
And knew that, had each got his due,
They should have died instead:
He had but killed a thing that lived,
Whilst they had killed the dead.

For he who sins a second time
Wakes a dead soul to pain,
And draws it from its spotted shroud,
And makes it bleed again,
And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,
And makes it bleed in vain!


Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb
With crooked arrows starred,
Silently we went round and round
The slippery asphalte yard;
Silently we went round and round,
And no man spoke a word.

Silently we went round and round,
And through each hollow mind
The Memory of dreadful things
Rushed like a dreadful wind,
And Horror stalked before each man,
And Terror crept behind.


The Warders strutted up and down,
And kept their herd of brutes,
Their uniforms were spick and span,
And they wore their Sunday suits,
But we knew the work they had been at,
By the quicklime on their boots.

For where a grave had opened wide,
There was no grave at all:
Only a stretch of mud and sand
By the hideous prison-wall,
And a little heap of burning lime,
That the man should have his pall.

For he has a pall, this wretched man,
Such as few men can claim:
Deep down below a prison-yard,
Naked for greater shame,
He lies, with fetters on each foot,
Wrapt in a sheet of flame!

And all the while the burning lime
Eats flesh and bone away,
It eats the brittle bone by night,
And the soft flesh by day,
It eats the flesh and bone by turns,
But it eats the heart alway.


For three long years they will not sow
Or root or seedling there:
For three long years the unblessed spot
Will sterile be and bare,
And look upon the wondering sky
With unreproachful stare.

They think a murderer's heart would taint
Each simple seed they sow.
It is not true! God's kindly earth
Is kindlier than men know,
And the red rose would but blow more red,
The white rose whiter blow.

Out of his mouth a red, red rose!
Out of his heart a white!
For who can say by what strange way,
Christ brings His will to light,
Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore
Bloomed in the great Pope's sight?

But neither milk-white rose nor red
May bloom in prison-air;
The shard, the pebble, and the flint,
Are what they give us there:
For flowers have been known to heal
A common man's despair.

So never will wine-red rose or white,
Petal by petal, fall
On that stretch of mud and sand that lies
By the hideous prison-wall,
To tell the men who tramp the yard
That God's Son died for all.


Yet though the hideous prison-wall
Still hems him round and round,
And a spirit may not walk by night
That is with fetters bound,
And a spirit may but weep that lies
In such unholy ground,

He is at peace - this wretched man -
At peace, or will be soon:
There is no thing to make him mad,
Nor does Terror walk at noon,
For the lampless Earth in which he lies
Has neither Sun nor Moon.

They hanged him as a beast is hanged:
They did not even toll
A requiem that might have brought
Rest to his startled soul,
But hurriedly they took him out,
And hid him in a hole.

They stripped him of his canvas clothes,
And gave him to the flies:
They mocked the swollen purple throat,
And the stark and staring eyes:
And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud
In which their convict lies.

The Chaplain would not kneel to pray
By his dishonoured grave:
Nor mark it with that blessed Cross
That Christ for sinners gave,
Because the man was one of those
Whom Christ came down to save.

Yet all is well; he has but passed
To Life's appointed bourne:
And alien tears will fill for him
Pity's long-broken urn,
For his mourners will be outcast men,
And outcasts always mourn


V


I know not whether Laws be right,
Or whether Laws be wrong;
All that we know who lie in gaol
Is that the wall is strong;
And that each day is like a year,
A year whose days are long.

But this I know, that every Law
That men have made for Man,
Since first Man took his brother's life,
And the sad world began,
But straws the wheat and saves the chaff
With a most evil fan.

This too I know - and wise it were
If each could know the same -
That every prison that men build
Is built with bricks of shame,
And bound with bars lest Christ should see
How men their brothers maim.

With bars they blur the gracious moon,
And blind the goodly sun:
And they do well to hide their Hell,
For in it things are done
That Son of God nor son of Man
Ever should look upon!


The vilest deeds like poison weeds,
Bloom well in prison-air;
It is only what is good in Man
That wastes and withers there:
Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,
And the Warder is Despair.

For they starve the little frightened child
Till it weeps both night and day:
And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,
And gibe the old and grey,
And some grow mad, and all grow bad,
And none a word may say.

Each narrow cell in which we dwell
Is a foul and dark latrine,
And the fetid breath of living Death
Chokes up each grated screen,
And all, but Lust, is turned to dust
In Humanity's machine.

The brackish water that we drink
Creeps with a loathsome slime,
And the bitter bread they weigh in scales
Is full of chalk and lime,
And Sleep will not lie down, but walks
Wild-eyed, and cries to Time.


But though lean Hunger and green Thirst
Like asp with adder fight,
We have little care of prison fare,
For what chills and kills outright
Is that every stone one lifts by day
Becomes one's heart by night.

With midnight always in one's heart,
And twilight in one's cell,
We turn the crank, or tear the rope,
Each in his separate Hell,
And the silence is more awful far
Than the sound of a brazen bell.

And never a human voice comes near
To speak a gentle word:
And the eye that watches through the door
Is pitiless and hard:
And by all forgot, we rot and rot,
With soul and body marred.

And thus we rust Life's iron chain
Degraded and alone:
And some men curse, and some men weep,
And some men make no moan:
But God's eternal Laws are kind
And break the heart of stone.


And every human heart that breaks,
In prison-cell or yard,
Is as that broken box that gave
Its treasure to the Lord,
And filled the unclean leper's house
With the scent of costliest nard.

Ah! happy they whose hearts can break
And peace of pardon win!
How else may man make straight his plan
And cleanse his soul from Sin?
How else but through a broken heart
May Lord Christ enter in?


And he of the swollen purple throat,
And the stark and staring eyes,
Waits for the holy hands that took
The Thief to Paradise;
And a broken and a contrite heart
The Lord will not despise.

The man in red who reads the Law
Gave him three weeks of life,
Three little weeks in which to heal
His soul of his soul's strife,
And cleanse from every blot of blood
The hand that held the knife.

And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,
The hand that held the steel:
For only blood can wipe out blood,
And only tears can heal:
And the crimson stain that was of Cain
Became Christ's snow-white seal.


VI


In Reading gaol by Reading town
There is a pit of shame,
And in it lies a wretched man
Eaten by teeth of flame,
In a burning winding-sheet he lies,
And his grave has got no name.

And there, till Christ call forth the dead,
In silence let him lie:
No need to waste the foolish tear,
Or heave the windy sigh:
The man had killed the thing he loved,
And so he had to die.

And all men kill the thing they love,
By all let this be heard,
Some do it with a bitter look,
Some with a flattering word,
The coward does it with a kiss,
The brave man with a sword!",Ballad
4,Gwendolyn Brooks,The Ballad Of Rudolph Reed,"Rudolph Reed was oaken.
His wife was oaken too.
And his two good girls and his good little man
Oakened as they grew.

""I am not hungry for berries.
I am not hungry for bread.
But hungry hungry for a house
Where at night a man in bed

""May never hear the plaster
Stir as if in pain.
May never hear the roaches
Falling like fat rain.

""Where never wife and children need
Go blinking through the gloom.
Where every room of many rooms
Will be full of room.

""Oh my home may have its east or west
Or north or south behind it.
All I know is I shall know it,
And fight for it when I find it.""

The agent's steep and steady stare
Corroded to a grin.
Why you black old, tough old hell of a man,
Move your family in!

Nary a grin grinned Rudolph Reed,
Nary a curse cursed he,
But moved in his House. With his dark little wife,
And his dark little children three.

A neighbor would look, with a yawning eye
That squeezed into a slit.
But the Rudolph Reeds and children three
Were too joyous to notice it.

For were they not firm in a home of their own
With windows everywhere
And a beautiful banistered stair
And a front yard for flowers and a back for grass?

The first night, a rock, big as two fists.
The second, a rock big as three.
But nary a curse cursed Rudolph Reed.
(Though oaken as man could be.)

The third night, a silvery ring of glass.
Patience arched to endure,
But he looked, and lo! small Mabel's blood
Was staining her gaze so pure.

Then up did rise our Roodoplh Reed
And pressed the hand of his wife,
And went to the door with a thirty-four
And a beastly butcher knife.

He ran like a mad thing into the night
And the words in his mouth were stinking.
By the time he had hurt his first white man
He was no longer thinking.

By the time he had hurt his fourth white man
Rudolph Reed was dead.
His neighbors gathered and kicked his corpse.
""Nigger--"" his neighbors said.

Small Mabel whimpered all night long,
For calling herself the cause.
Her oak-eyed mother did no thing
But change the bloody gauze.",Ballad
5,Algernon Charles Swinburne,A Ballad Of Dreamland,"I hid my heart in a nest of roses,
Out of the sun's way, hidden apart;
In a softer bed than the soft white snow's is,
Under the roses I hid my heart.
Why would it sleep not? why should it start,
When never a leaf of the rose-tree stirred?
What made sleep flutter his wings and part?
Only the song of a secret bird.

Lie still, I said, for the wind's wing closes,
And mild leaves muffle the keen sun's dart;
Lie still, for the wind on the warm seas dozes,
And the wind is unquieter yet than thou art.
Does a thought in thee still as a thorn's wound smart?
Does the fang still fret thee of hope deferred?
What bids the lips of thy sleep dispart?
Only the song of a secret bird.

The green land's name that a charm encloses, 
It never was writ in the traveller's chart,
And sweet on its trees as the fruit that grows is,
It never was sold in the merchant's mart.
The swallows of dreams through its dim fields dart,
And sleep's are the tunes in its tree-tops heard;
No hound's note wakens the wildwood hart,
Only the song of a secret bird.


ENVOI

In the world of dreams I have chosen my part,
To sleep for a season and hear no word
Of true love's truth or of light love's art,
Only the song of a secret bird.",Ballad
6,Sara Teasdale,A Ballad Of The Two Knights,"Two knights rode forth at early dawn 
A-seeking maids to wed, 
Said one, ""My lady must be fair, 
With gold hair on her head.""

Then spake the other knight-at-arms: 
""I care not for her face, 
But she I love must be a dove 
For purity and grace.""

And each knight blew upon his horn 
And went his separate way, 
And each knight found a lady-love 
Before the fall of day.

But she was brown who should have had 
The shining yellow hair -- 
I ween the knights forgot their words 
Or else they ceased to care.

For he who wanted purity 
Brought home a wanton wild, 
And when each saw the other knight 
I ween that each knight smiled.",Ballad
7,Algernon Charles Swinburne,A Ballad Of Death,"Kneel down, fair Love, and fill thyself with tears,
Girdle thyself with sighing for a girth
Upon the sides of mirth,
Cover thy lips and eyelids, let thine ears
Be filled with rumour of people sorrowing;
Make thee soft raiment out of woven sighs
Upon the flesh to cleave,
Set pains therein and many a grievous thing,
And many sorrows after each his wise
For armlet and for gorget and for sleeve. 

O Love's lute heard about the lands of death,
Left hanged upon the trees that were therein;
O Love and Time and Sin,
Three singing mouths that mourn now underbreath,
Three lovers, each one evil spoken of;
O smitten lips wherethrough this voice of mine
Came softer with her praise;
Abide a little for our lady's love.
The kisses of her mouth were more than wine,
And more than peace the passage of her days. 

O Love, thou knowest if she were good to see.
O Time, thou shalt not find in any land
Till, cast out of thine hand,
The sunlight and the moonlight fail from thee,
Another woman fashioned like as this.
O Sin, thou knowest that all thy shame in her
Was made a goodly thing;
Yea, she caught Shame and shamed him with her kiss,
With her fair kiss, and lips much lovelier
Than lips of amorous roses in late spring. 

By night there stood over against my bed
Queen Venus with a hood striped gold and black,
Both sides drawn fully back
From brows wherein the sad blood failed of red,
And temples drained of purple and full of death.
Her curled hair had the wave of sea-water
And the sea's gold in it.
Her eyes were as a dove's that sickeneth.
Strewn dust of gold she had shed over her,
And pearl and purple and amber on her feet. 

Upon her raiment of dyed sendaline
Were painted all the secret ways of love
And covered things thereof,
That hold delight as grape-flowers hold their wine;
Red mouths of maidens and red feet of doves,
And brides that kept within the bride-chamber
Their garment of soft shame,
And weeping faces of the wearied loves
That swoon in sleep and awake wearier,
With heat of lips and hair shed out like flame. 

The tears that through her eyelids fell on me
Made mine own bitter where they ran between
As blood had fallen therein,
She saying; Arise, lift up thine eyes and see
If any glad thing be or any good
Now the best thing is taken forth of us;
Even she to whom all praise
Was as one flower in a great multitude,
One glorious flower of many and glorious,
One day found gracious among many days: 

Even she whose handmaiden was Love--to whom
At kissing times across her stateliest bed
Kings bowed themselves and shed
Pale wine, and honey with the honeycomb,
And spikenard bruised for a burnt-offering;
Even she between whose lips the kiss became
As fire and frankincense;
Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king,
Whose eyes were as the morning purged with flame,
Whose eyelids as sweet savour issuing thence. 

Then I beheld, and lo on the other side
My lady's likeness crowned and robed and dead.
Sweet still, but now not red,
Was the shut mouth whereby men lived and died.
And sweet, but emptied of the blood's blue shade,
The great curled eyelids that withheld her eyes.
And sweet, but like spoilt gold,
The weight of colour in her tresses weighed.
And sweet, but as a vesture with new dyes,
The body that was clothed with love of old. 

Ah! that my tears filled all her woven hair
And all the hollow bosom of her gown--
Ah! that my tears ran down
Even to the place where many kisses were,
Even where her parted breast-flowers have place,
Even where they are cloven apart--who knows not this?
Ah! the flowers cleave apart
And their sweet fills the tender interspace;
Ah! the leaves grown thereof were things to kiss
Ere their fine gold was tarnished at the heart. 

Ah! in the days when God did good to me,
Each part about her was a righteous thing;
Her mouth an almsgiving,
The glory of her garments charity,
The beauty of her bosom a good deed,
In the good days when God kept sight of us;
Love lay upon her eyes,
And on that hair whereof the world takes heed;
And all her body was more virtuous
Than souls of women fashioned otherwise. 

Now, ballad, gather poppies in thine hands
And sheaves of brier and many rusted sheaves
Rain-rotten in rank lands,
Waste marigold and late unhappy leaves
And grass that fades ere any of it be mown;
And when thy bosom is filled full thereof
Seek out Death's face ere the light altereth,
And say ""My master that was thrall to Love
Is become thrall to Death.""
Bow down before him, ballad, sigh and groan.
But make no sojourn in thy outgoing;
For haply it may be
That when thy feet return at evening
Death shall come in with thee.",Ballad

9,Geoffrey Chaucer,A Ballad Of Gentleness,"The firste stock-father of gentleness,
What man desireth gentle for to be,
Must follow his trace, and all his wittes dress,
Virtue to love, and vices for to flee;
For unto virtue longeth dignity,
And not the reverse, safely dare I deem,
All wear he mitre, crown, or diademe.

This firste stock was full of righteousness,
True of his word, sober, pious, and free,
Clean of his ghost, and loved business,
Against the vice of sloth, in honesty;
And, but his heir love virtue as did he,
He is not gentle, though he riche seem,
All wear he mitre, crown, or diademe.

Vice may well be heir to old richess,
But there may no man, as men may well see,
Bequeath his heir his virtuous nobless;
That is appropried to no degree,
But to the first Father in majesty,
Which makes his heire him that doth him queme,
All wear he mitre, crown, or diademe.",Ballad
10,Edgar Allan Poe,To -- -- --. Ulalume: A Ballad,"The skies they were ashen and sober;
          The leaves they were crisped and sere-
          The leaves they were withering and sere;
      It was night in the lonesome October
          Of my most immemorial year;
      It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,
          In the misty mid region of Weir-
      It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,
          In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

      Here once, through an alley Titanic,
          Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul-
          Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.
      There were days when my heart was volcanic
          As the scoriac rivers that roll-
          As the lavas that restlessly roll
      Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek
          In the ultimate climes of the pole-
      That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
          In the realms of the boreal pole.

      Our talk had been serious and sober,
          But our thoughts they were palsied and sere-
          Our memories were treacherous and sere-
      For we knew not the month was October,
          And we marked not the night of the year-
          (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)
      We noted not the dim lake of Auber-
          (Though once we had journeyed down here),
      Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,
          Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

      And now, as the night was senescent,
          And star-dials pointed to morn-
          As the star-dials hinted of morn-
      At the end of our path a liquescent
          And nebulous lustre was born,
      Out of which a miraculous crescent
          Arose with a duplicate horn-
      Astarte's bediamonded crescent
          Distinct with its duplicate horn.

      And I said- 'She is warmer than Dian:
          She rolls through an ether of sighs-
          She revels in a region of sighs:
      She has seen that the tears are not dry on
          These cheeks, where the worm never dies,
      And has come past the stars of the Lion,
          To point us the path to the skies-
          To the Lethean peace of the skies-
      Come up, in despite of the Lion,
          To shine on us with her bright eyes-
      Come up through the lair of the Lion,
          With love in her luminous eyes.'

      But Psyche, uplifting her finger,
          Said- 'Sadly this star I mistrust-
          Her pallor I strangely mistrust:-
      Oh, hasten!- oh, let us not linger!
          Oh, fly!- let us fly!- for we must.'
      In terror she spoke, letting sink her
          Wings until they trailed in the dust-
      In agony sobbed, letting sink her
          Plumes till they trailed in the dust-
          Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.

      I replied- 'This is nothing but dreaming:
          Let us on by this tremulous light!
          Let us bathe in this crystalline light!
      Its Sybilic splendor is beaming
          With Hope and in Beauty to-night:-
          See!- it flickers up the sky through the night!
      Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,
          And be sure it will lead us aright-
      We safely may trust to a gleaming
          That cannot but guide us aright,
          Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.'

      Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,
          And tempted her out of her gloom-
          And conquered her scruples and gloom;
      And we passed to the end of the vista,
          But were stopped by the door of a tomb-
          By the door of a legended tomb;
      And I said- 'What is written, sweet sister,
          On the door of this legended tomb?'
          She replied- 'Ulalume- Ulalume-
          'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!'

      Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
          As the leaves that were crisped and sere-
          As the leaves that were withering and sere-
      And I cried- 'It was surely October
          On this very night of last year
          That I journeyed- I journeyed down here-
          That I brought a dread burden down here-
          On this night of all nights in the year,
          Ah, what demon has tempted me here?
      Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber-
          This misty mid region of Weir-
      Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber,
          This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.'",Ballad
11,Allen Ginsberg,An Eastern Ballad,"I speak of love that comes to mind: 
The moon is faithful, although blind; 
She moves in thought she cannot speak. 
Perfect care has made her bleak. 

I never dreamed the sea so deep, 
The earth so dark; so long my sleep, 
I have become another child. 
I wake to see the world go wild.",Ballad
12,Dylan Thomas,Ballad Of The Long-Legged Bait,"The bows glided down, and the coast
Blackened with birds took a last look
At his thrashing hair and whale-blue eye;
The trodden town rang its cobbles for luck.

Then good-bye to the fishermanned
Boat with its anchor free and fast
As a bird hooking over the sea,
High and dry by the top of the mast,

Whispered the affectionate sand
And the bulwarks of the dazzled quay.
For my sake sail, and never look back,
Said the looking land.

Sails drank the wind, and white as milk
He sped into the drinking dark;
The sun shipwrecked west on a pearl
And the moon swam out of its hulk.

Funnels and masts went by in a whirl.
Good-bye to the man on the sea-legged deck
To the gold gut that sings on his reel
To the bait that stalked out of the sack,

For we saw him throw to the swift flood
A girl alive with his hooks through her lips;
All the fishes were rayed in blood,
Said the dwindling ships.

Good-bye to chimneys and funnels,
Old wives that spin in the smoke,
He was blind to the eyes of candles
In the praying windows of waves

But heard his bait buck in the wake
And tussle in a shoal of loves.
Now cast down your rod, for the whole
Of the sea is hilly with whales,

She longs among horses and angels,
The rainbow-fish bend in her joys,
Floated the lost cathedral
Chimes of the rocked buoys.

Where the anchor rode like a gull
Miles over the moonstruck boat
A squall of birds bellowed and fell,
A cloud blew the rain from its throat;

He saw the storm smoke out to kill
With fuming bows and ram of ice,
Fire on starlight, rake Jesu's stream;
And nothing shone on the water's face

But the oil and bubble of the moon,
Plunging and piercing in his course
The lured fish under the foam
Witnessed with a kiss.

Whales in the wake like capes and Alps
Quaked the sick sea and snouted deep,
Deep the great bushed bait with raining lips
Slipped the fins of those humpbacked tons

And fled their love in a weaving dip.
Oh, Jericho was falling in their lungs!
She nipped and dived in the nick of love,
Spun on a spout like a long-legged ball

Till every beast blared down in a swerve
Till every turtle crushed from his shell
Till every bone in the rushing grave
Rose and crowed and fell!

Good luck to the hand on the rod,
There is thunder under its thumbs;
Gold gut is a lightning thread,
His fiery reel sings off its flames,

The whirled boat in the burn of his blood
Is crying from nets to knives,
Oh the shearwater birds and their boatsized brood
Oh the bulls of Biscay and their calves

Are making under the green, laid veil
The long-legged beautiful bait their wives.
Break the black news and paint on a sail
Huge weddings in the waves,

Over the wakeward-flashing spray
Over the gardens of the floor
Clash out the mounting dolphin's day,
My mast is a bell-spire,

Strike and smoothe, for my decks are drums,
Sing through the water-spoken prow
The octopus walking into her limbs
The polar eagle with his tread of snow.

From salt-lipped beak to the kick of the stern
Sing how the seal has kissed her dead!
The long, laid minute's bride drifts on
Old in her cruel bed.

Over the graveyard in the water
Mountains and galleries beneath
Nightingale and hyena
Rejoicing for that drifting death

Sing and howl through sand and anemone
Valley and sahara in a shell,
Oh all the wanting flesh his enemy
Thrown to the sea in the shell of a girl


Is old as water and plain as an eel;
Always good-bye to the long-legged bread
Scattered in the paths of his heels
For the salty birds fluttered and fed

And the tall grains foamed in their bills;
Always good-bye to the fires of the face,
For the crab-backed dead on the sea-bed rose
And scuttled over her eyes,

The blind, clawed stare is cold as sleet.
The tempter under the eyelid
Who shows to the selves asleep
Mast-high moon-white women naked

Walking in wishes and lovely for shame
Is dumb and gone with his flame of brides.
Susannah's drowned in the bearded stream
And no-one stirs at Sheba's side

But the hungry kings of the tides;
Sin who had a woman's shape
Sleeps till Silence blows on a cloud
And all the lifted waters walk and leap.

Lucifer that bird's dropping
Out of the sides of the north
Has melted away and is lost
Is always lost in her vaulted breath,

Venus lies star-struck in her wound
And the sensual ruins make
Seasons over the liquid world,
White springs in the dark.

Always good-bye, cried the voices through the shell,
Good-bye always, for the flesh is cast
And the fisherman winds his reel
With no more desire than a ghost.

Always good luck, praised the finned in the feather
Bird after dark and the laughing fish
As the sails drank up the hail of thunder
And the long-tailed lightning lit his catch.

The boat swims into the six-year weather,
A wind throws a shadow and it freezes fast.
See what the gold gut drags from under
Mountains and galleries to the crest!

See what clings to hair and skull
As the boat skims on with drinking wings!
The statues of great rain stand still,
And the flakes fall like hills.

Sing and strike his heavy haul
Toppling up the boatside in a snow of light!
His decks are drenched with miracles.
Oh miracle of fishes! The long dead bite!

Out of the urn a size of a man
Out of the room the weight of his trouble
Out of the house that holds a town
In the continent of a fossil

One by one in dust and shawl,
Dry as echoes and insect-faced,
His fathers cling to the hand of the girl
And the dead hand leads the past,

Leads them as children and as air
On to the blindly tossing tops;
The centuries throw back their hair
And the old men sing from newborn lips:

Time is bearing another son.
Kill Time! She turns in her pain!
The oak is felled in the acorn
And the hawk in the egg kills the wren.

He who blew the great fire in
And died on a hiss of flames
Or walked the earth in the evening
Counting the denials of the grains

Clings to her drifting hair, and climbs;
And he who taught their lips to sing
Weeps like the risen sun among
The liquid choirs of his tribes.

The rod bends low, divining land,
And through the sundered water crawls
A garden holding to her hand
With birds and animals

With men and women and waterfalls
Trees cool and dry in the whirlpool of ships
And stunned and still on the green, laid veil
Sand with legends in its virgin laps

And prophets loud on the burned dunes;
Insects and valleys hold her thighs hard,
Times and places grip her breast bone,
She is breaking with seasons and clouds;

Round her trailed wrist fresh water weaves,
with moving fish and rounded stones
Up and down the greater waves
A separate river breathes and runs;

Strike and sing his catch of fields
For the surge is sown with barley,
The cattle graze on the covered foam,
The hills have footed the waves away,

With wild sea fillies and soaking bridles
With salty colts and gales in their limbs
All the horses of his haul of miracles
Gallop through the arched, green farms,

Trot and gallop with gulls upon them
And thunderbolts in their manes.
O Rome and Sodom To-morrow and London
The country tide is cobbled with towns

And steeples pierce the cloud on her shoulder
And the streets that the fisherman combed
When his long-legged flesh was a wind on fire
And his loin was a hunting flame

Coil from the thoroughfares of her hair
And terribly lead him home alive
Lead her prodigal home to his terror,
The furious ox-killing house of love.

Down, down, down, under the ground,
Under the floating villages,
Turns the moon-chained and water-wound
Metropolis of fishes,

There is nothing left of the sea but its sound,
Under the earth the loud sea walks,
In deathbeds of orchards the boat dies down
And the bait is drowned among hayricks,

Land, land, land, nothing remains
Of the pacing, famous sea but its speech,
And into its talkative seven tombs
The anchor dives through the floors of a church.

Good-bye, good luck, struck the sun and the moon,
To the fisherman lost on the land.
He stands alone in the door of his home,
With his long-legged heart in his hand.",Ballad
13,Walt Whitman,"A Boston Ballad, 1854","TO get betimes in Boston town, I rose this morning early;
   Here's a good place at the corner--I must stand and see the show.

   Clear the way there, Jonathan!
   Way for the President's marshal! Way for the government cannon!
   Way for the Federal foot and dragoons--and the apparitions copiously
         tumbling.

   I love to look on the stars and stripes--I hope the fifes will play
         Yankee Doodle.

   How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops!
   Every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston town.

   A fog follows--antiques of the same come limping,
   Some appear wooden-legged, and some appear bandaged and bloodless. 10

   Why this is indeed a show! It has called the dead out of the earth!
   The old grave-yards of the hills have hurried to see!
   Phantoms! phantoms countless by flank and rear!
   Cock'd hats of mothy mould! crutches made of mist!
   Arms in slings! old men leaning on young men's shoulders!

   What troubles you, Yankee phantoms? What is all this chattering of
         bare gums?
   Does the ague convulse your limbs? Do you mistake your crutches for
         fire-locks, and level them?

   If you blind your eyes with tears, you will not see the President's
         marshal;
   If you groan such groans, you might balk the government cannon.

   For shame, old maniacs! Bring down those toss'd arms, and let your
         white hair be;                                               20
   Here gape your great grand-sons--their wives gaze at them from the
         windows,
   See how well dress'd--see how orderly they conduct themselves.

   Worse and worse! Can't you stand it? Are you retreating?
   Is this hour with the living too dead for you?

   Retreat then! Pell-mell!
   To your graves! Back! back to the hills, old limpers!
   I do not think you belong here, anyhow.

   But there is one thing that belongs here--shall I tell you what it
         is, gentlemen of Boston?
   I will whisper it to the Mayor--he shall send a committee to England;
   They shall get a grant from the Parliament, go with a cart to the
         royal vault--haste!                                          30

   Dig out King George's coffin, unwrap him quick from the grave-
         clothes, box up his bones for a journey;
   Find a swift Yankee clipper--here is freight for you, black-bellied
         clipper,
   Up with your anchor! shake out your sails! steer straight toward
         Boston bay.

   Now call for the President's marshal again, bring out the government
         cannon,
   Fetch home the roarers from Congress, make another procession, guard
         it with foot and dragoons.

   This centre-piece for them:
   Look! all orderly citizens--look from the windows, women!

   The committee open the box, set up the regal ribs, glue those that
         will not stay,
   Clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the
         skull.

   You have got your revenge, old buster! The crown is come to its own,
         and more than its own.

   Stick your hands in your pockets, Jonathan--you are a made man from
         this day;                                                    40

15,Sidney Lanier,A Ballad Of The Trees And The Master,"Into the woods my Master went,
Clean forspent, forspent.
Into the woods my Master came,
Forspent with love and shame.
But the olives they were not blind to Him,
The little gray leaves were kind to Him:
The thorn-tree had a mind to Him
When into the woods He came.

Out of the woods my Master went,
And He was well content.
Out of the woods my Master came,

16,Ezra Pound,Ballad For Gloom,"For God, our God is a gallant foe 
That playeth behind the veil. 

I have loved my God as a child at heart 
That seeketh deep bosoms for rest, 
I have loved my God as a maid to man‚Äî 
But lo, this thing is best: 

To love your God as a gallant foe that plays behind the veil; 
To meet your God as the night winds meet beyond Arcturus' pale. 

I have played with God for a woman, 
I have staked with my God for truth, 
I have lost to my God as a man, clear-eyed‚Äî 
His dice be not of ruth. 

For I am made as a naked blade, 
But hear ye this thing in sooth: 

Who loseth to God as man to man 
Shall win at the turn of the game. 
I have drawn my blade where the lightnings meet 
But the ending is the same: 
Who loseth to God as the sword blades lose 
Shall win at the end of the game.

Whom God deigns not to overthrow hath need of triple mail.",Ballad
17,Edna St. Vincent Millay,The Ballad Of The Harp-Weaver,"""Son,"" said my mother,
When I was knee-high,
""you've need of clothes to cover you,
and not a rag have I.

""There's nothing in the house
To make a boy breeches,
Nor shears to cut a cloth with,
Nor thread to take stitches.

""There's nothing in the house
But a loaf-end of rye,
And a harp with a woman's head
Nobody will buy,""
And she began to cry.

That was in the early fall.
When came the late fall,
""Son,"" she said, ""the sight of you
Makes your mother's blood crawl,‚Äî

""Little skinny shoulder-blades
Sticking through your clothes!
And where you'll get a jacket from
God above knows.

""It's lucky for me, lad,
Your daddy's in the ground,
And can't see the way I let
His son go around!""
And she made a queer sound.

That was in the late fall.
When the winter came,
I'd not a pair of breeches
Nor a shirt to my name.

I couldn't go to school,
Or out of doors to play.
And all the other little boys
Passed our way.

""Son,"" said my mother,
""Come, climb into my lap,
And I'll chafe your little bones
While you take a nap.""

And, oh, but we were silly
For half and hour or more,
Me with my long legs,
Dragging on the floor,

A-rock-rock-rocking
To a mother-goose rhyme!
Oh, but we were happy
For half an hour's time!

But there was I, a great boy,
And what would folks say
To hear my mother singing me
To sleep all day,
In such a daft way?

Men say the winter
Was bad that year;
Fuel was scarce,
And food was dear.

A wind with a wolf's head
Howled about our door,
And we burned up the chairs
And sat upon the floor.

All that was left us
Was a chair we couldn't break,
And the harp with a woman's head
Nobody would take,
For song or pity's sake.

The night before Christmas
I cried with cold,
I cried myself to sleep 
Like a two-year old.

And in the deep night
I felt my mother rise,
And stare down upon me
With love in her eyes.

I saw my mother sitting
On the one good chair,
A light falling on her
From I couldn't tell where.

Looking nineteen,
And not a day older,
And the harp with a woman's head
Leaned against her shoulder.

Her thin fingers, moving
In the thin, tall strings,
Were weav-weav-weaving
Wonderful things.

Many bright threads,
From where I couldn't see,
Were running through the harp-strings
Rapidly,

And gold threads whistling
Through my mother's hand.
I saw the web grow,
And the pattern expand.

She wove a child's jacket,
And when it was done
She laid it on the floor
And wove another one.

She wove a red cloak
So regal to see,
""She's made it for a king's son,""
I said, ""and not for me.""
But I knew it was for me.

She wove a pair of breeches
Quicker than that!
She wove a pair of boots
And a little cocked hat.

She wove a pair of mittens,
Shw wove a little blouse,
She wove all night
In the still, cold house.

She sang as she worked,
And the harp-strings spoke;
Her voice never faltered,
And the thread never broke,
And when I awoke,‚Äî

There sat my mother
With the harp against her shoulder,
Looking nineteeen,
And not a day older, 

A smile about her lips,
And a light about her head,
And her hands in the harp-strings
Frozen dead.

And piled beside her
And toppling to the skies,
Were the clothes of a king's son,
Just my size.",Ballad
18,Ezra Pound,Ballad Of The Goodly Fere,"Ha' we lost the goodliest fere o' all
For the priests and the gallows tree?
Aye lover he was of brawny men,
O' ships and the open sea.

When they came wi' a host to take Our Man
His smile was good to see,
""First let these go!"" quo' our Goodly Fere,
""Or I'll see ye damned,"" says he.

Aye he sent us out through the crossed high spears
And the scorn of his laugh rang free,
""Why took ye not me when I walked about
Alone in the town?"" says he.

Oh we drank his ""Hale"" in the good red wine
When we last made company,
No capon priest was the Goodly Fere
But a man o' men was he.

I ha' seen him drive a hundred men
Wi' a bundle o' cords swung free,
That they took the high and holy house
For their pawn and treasury.

They'll no' get him a' in a book I think
Though they write it cunningly;
No mouse of the scrolls was the Goodly Fere
But aye loved the open sea.

If they think they ha' snared our Goodly Fere
They are fools to the last degree.
""I'll go to the feast,"" quo' our Goodly Fere,
""Though I go to the gallows tree.""

""Ye ha' seen me heal the lame and blind,
And wake the dead,"" says he,
""Ye shall see one thing to master all:
'Tis how a brave man dies on the tree.""

A son of God was the Goodly Fere
That bade us his brothers be.
I ha' seen him cow a thousand men.
I have seen him upon the tree.

He cried no cry when they drave the nails
And the blood gushed hot and free,
The hounds of the crimson sky gave tongue
But never a cry cried he.

I ha' seen him cow a thousand men
On the hills o' Galilee,
They whined as he walked out calm between,
Wi' his eyes like the grey o' the sea,

Like the sea that brooks no voyaging
With the winds unleashed and free,
Like the sea that he cowed at Genseret
Wi' twey words spoke' suddently.

A master of men was the Goodly Fere,
A mate of the wind and sea,
If they think they ha' slain our Goodly Fere
They are fools eternally.

I ha' seen him eat o' the honey-comb
Sin' they nailed him to the tree.",Ballad
19,Thomas Lovell Beddoes,Ballad Of Human Life,"WHEN we were girl and boy together,  
 We toss‚Äôd about the flowers  
 And wreath‚Äôd the blushing hours  
Into a posy green and sweet.  
 I sought the youngest, best, 
 And never was at rest  
Till I had laid them at thy fairy feet.  
But the days of childhood they were fleet,  
 And the blooming sweet-briar-breath‚Äôd weather,  
 When we were boy and girl together.
 
Then we were lad and lass together,  
 And sought the kiss of night  
 Before we felt aright,  
Sitting and singing soft and sweet.  
 The dearest thought of heart 
 With thee ‚Äôt was joy to part,  
And the greater half was thine, as meet.  
Still my eyelid‚Äôs dewy, my veins they beat  
 At the starry summer-evening weather,  
 When we were lad and lass together.
 
And we are man and wife together,  
 Although thy breast, once bold  
 With song, be clos‚Äôd and cold  
Beneath flowers‚Äô roots and birds‚Äô light feet.  
 Yet sit I by thy tomb,
 And dissipate the gloom  
With songs of loving faith and sorrow sweet.  
And fate and darkling grave kind dreams do cheat,  
 That, while fair life, young hope, despair and death are,  
 We ‚Äôre boy and girl, and lass and lad, and man and wife together.",Ballad
20,Edwin Arlington Robinson,Ballad By The Fire,"Slowly I smoke and hug my knee, 
The while a witless masquerade 
Of things that only children see 
Floats in a mist of light and shade: 
They pass, a flimsy cavalcade, 
And with a weak, remindful glow, 
The falling embers break and fade, 
As one by one the phantoms go. 

Then, with a melancholy glee 
To think where once my fancy strayed, 
I muse on what the years may be 
Whose coming tales are all unsaid, 
Till tongs and shovel, snugly laid 
Within their shadowed niches, grow 

By grim degrees to pick and spade, 
As one by one the phantoms go. 

But then, what though the mystic Three 
Around me ply their merry trade? -- 
And Charon soon may carry me 
Across the gloomy Stygian glade? -- 

Be up, my soul! nor be afraid 
Of what some unborn year may show; 
But mind your human debts are paid, 
As one by one the phantoms go.

21,Fran√ßois Villon,The Ballad Of The Proverbs,"So rough the goat will scratch, it cannot sleep.
So often goes the pot to the well that it breaks.
So long you heat iron, it will glow;
so heavily you hammer it, it shatters.
So good is the man as his praise;
so far he will go, and he's forgotten;
so bad he behaves, and he's despised.
So loud you cry Christmas, it comes.

So glib you talk, you end up in contradictions.
So good is your credit as the favors you got.
So much you promise that you will back out.
So doggedly you beg that your wish is granted;
so high climbs the price when you want a thing;
so much you want it that you pay the price;
so familiar it gets to you, you want it no more.
So loud you cry Christmas, it comes.

So, you love a dog.  Then feed it!
So long a song will run that people learn it.
So long you keep the fruit, it will rot.
So hot the struggle for a spot that it is won;
so cool you keep your act that your spirit freezes;
so hurriedly you act that you run into bad luck;
so tight you embrace that your catch slips away.
So loud you cry Christmas, it comes.

So you scoff and laugh, and the fun is gone.
So you crave and spend, and lose your shirt.
So candid you are, no blow can be too low.
So good as a gift should a promise be.
So, if you love God, you obey the Church.
So, when you give much, you borrow much.
So, shifting winds turn to storm.
So loud you cry Christmas, it comes.

so, round the world he goes, but return he will,
so humbled and beaten back into servility.
So loud you cry Christmas, it is here.",Ballad
22,William Butler Yeats,The Ballad Of Father Gilligan,"The old priest Peter Gilligan
Was weary night and day
For half his flock were in their beds
Or under green sods lay.

Once, while he nodded in a chair
At the moth-hour of the eve
Another poor man sent for him,
And he began to grieve.

'I have no rest, nor joy, nor peace,
For people die and die;
And after cried he, 'God forgive!
My body spake not I!'

He knelt, and leaning on the chair
He prayed and fell asleep;
And the moth-hour went from the fields,
And stars began to peep.

They slowly into millions grew,
And leaves shook in the wind
And God covered the world with shade
And whispered to mankind.

Upon the time of sparrow chirp
When the moths came once more,
The old priest Peter Gilligan
Stood upright on the floor.

'Mavrone, mavrone! The man has died
While I slept in the chair.'
He roused his horse out of its sleep
And rode with little care.

He rode now as he never rode,
By rocky lane and fen;
The sick man's wife opened the door,
'Father! you come again!'

'And is the poor man dead?' he cried
'He died an hour ago.'
The old priest Peter Gilligan
In grief swayed to and fro.

'When you were gone, he turned and died,
As merry as a bird.'
The old priest Peter Gilligan
He knelt him at that word.

'He Who hath made the night of stars
For souls who tire and bleed,
Sent one of this great angels down,
To help me in my need.

'He Who is wrapped in purple robes,
With planets in His care
Had pity on the least of things
Asleep upon a chair.'",Ballad
23,Francis Duggan,A Ballad Of Wasted Years,"I have walked through tougher Harlem where few strangers dare to go
And I've been in London City in the rain and in the snow
And I've worked in inner Melbourne in the searing summer heat
And believe me if I tell you I have earned the bread I eat.

I have laboured in deep trenches with my life I've took a dare
And I've worked in cherry pickers ninety foot up in the air
And the hands of time keep turning and the years go quickly by
And the man who lives on welfare is still better off than I.

And who needs the tag of good worker it's no big deal anyway
He's a wiser and better off man who sits at home all day
And his conscience doesn't prick him isn't he the lucky one
And must I be one great idiot to go labouring in the sun.

I was low in social ladder and I still am way down low
And I feel my life's been wasted for my years have nought to show
Some may say he's a good worker that's of little use to me
All I need is lots of money I don't need your sympathy.

I felt happy for a brief while in a green Land miles away
In that beautiful green Country where I lived for many a day
I felt inwardly contented even though I was quite poor
Listening to the pipits piping in the meads of Annagloor.

Till the wanderlust possessed me I grew restless as the wind
Pity on all migrant workers, pity on all wandering kind
Went to live in foreign city worked with strong hard working men
But I've nought to show for labour I'm poor now as I was then.

In Ireland I cut down pine trees in the hills where bracken grow
And in Wales I picked potatoes many, many years ago
I have laboured for a living on myself I have been cruel
All the World laughs at an idiot all the World laughs at a fool.

I am getting old and weary and what hair I've left is gray
And I'm well beyond the fifty and I've seen a better day
And like the work weary work horse all the better years are gone
And I still work as a labourer and I still keep plodding on.

Please don't say he's a good worker such words I don't wish to hear
For I've nought to show for labour though I've worked for many a year
Words like 'good hard working fellow' does not do a thing for me
All I need is lots of money, I don't need your sympathy.",Ballad

they stared at each other
two figures on the crossroads in the desert.

America screamed
The lion roared
They leaped at each other
America desperate to win
Fighting with bombs, flamethrowers,
knives forks submarines.

26,Banjo Paterson,A Ballad Of Ducks,"The railway rattled and roared and swung 
With jolting and bumping trucks. 
The sun, like a billiard red ball, hung 
In the Western sky: and the tireless tongue 
Of the wild-eyed man in the corner told 
This terrible tale of the days of old, 
And the party that ought to have kept the ducks. 
""Well, it ain't all joy bein' on the land 
With an overdraft that'd knock you flat; 
And the rabbits have pretty well took command; 
But the hardest thing for a man to stand 
Is the feller who says 'Well I told you so! 
You should ha' done this way, don't you know!' -- 
I could lay a bait for a man like that. 

""The grasshoppers struck us in ninety-one 
And what they leave -- well, it ain't de luxe. 
But a growlin' fault-findin' son of a gun 
Who'd lent some money to stock our run -- 
I said they'd eaten what grass we had -- 
Says he, 'Your management's very bad; 
You had a right to have kept some ducks!' 

""To have kept some ducks! And the place was white! 
Wherever you went you had to tread 
On grasshoppers guzzlin' day and night; 
And then with a swoosh they rose in flight, 
If you didn't look out for yourself they'd fly 
Like bullets into your open eye 
And knock it out of the back of your head. 

""There isn't a turkey or goose or swan, 
Or a duck that quacks, or a hen that clucks, 
Can make a difference on a run 
When a grasshopper plague has once begun; 
'If you'd finance us,' I says, 'I'd buy 
Ten thousand emus and have a try; 
The job,' I says, 'is too big for ducks! 

""'You must fetch a duck when you come to stay; 
A great big duck -- a Muscovy toff -- 
Ready and fit,' I says, 'for the fray; 
And if the grasshoppers come our way 
You turn your duck into the lucerne patch, 
And I'd be ready to make a match 
That the grasshoppers eat his feathers off!"" 

""He came to visit us by and by, 
And it just so happened one day in spring 
A kind of cloud came over the sky -- 
A wall of grasshoppers nine miles high, 
And nine miles thick, and nine hundred wide, 
Flyin' in regiments, side by side, 
And eatin' up every living thing. 

""All day long, like a shower of rain, 
You'd hear 'em smackin' against the wall, 
Tap, tap, tap, on the window pane, 
And they'd rise and jump at the house again 
Till their crippled carcasses piled outside. 
But what did it matter if thousands died -- 
A million wouldn't be missed at all. 

""We were drinkin' grasshoppers -- so to speak -- 
Till we skimmed their carcasses off the spring; 
And they fell so thick in the station creek 
They choked the waterholes all the week. 
There was scarcely room for a trout to rise, 
And they'd only take artificial flies -- 
They got so sick of the real thing. 

""An Arctic snowstorm was beat to rags 
When the hoppers rose for their morning flight 
With the flapping noise like a million flags: 
And the kitchen chimney was stuffed with bags 
For they'd fall right into the fire, and fry 
Till the cook sat down and began to cry -- 
And never a duck or fowl in sight. 

""We strolled across to the railroad track -- 
Under a cover beneath some trucks, 
I sees a feather and hears a quack; 
I stoops and I pulls the tarpaulin back -- 
Every duck in the place was there, 
No good to them was the open air.

With green strings she makes the warp of her basket,
She makes the shoulder-straps of her basket

And she piles her hair up on the left side of her headpiece.

30,Alfred Lord Tennyson,The Revenge - A Ballad Of The Fleet,"I

AT Flores, in the Azores Sir Richard Grenville lay,  
And a pinnace, like a flutter‚Äôd bird, came flying from far away;  
‚ÄúSpanish ships of war at sea! we have sighted fifty-three!‚Äù  
Then sware Lord Thomas Howard: ‚Äú‚ÄôFore God I am no coward;  
But I cannot meet them here, for my ships are out of gear,          
And the half my men are sick. I must fly, but follow quick.  
We are six ships of the line; can we fight with fifty-three?‚Äù  
 
II

Then spake Sir Richard Grenville: ‚ÄúI know you are no coward;  
You fly them for a moment to fight with them again.  
But I‚Äôve ninety men and more that are lying sick ashore.         
I should count myself the coward if I left them, my Lord Howard,  
To these Inquisition dogs and the devildoms of Spain.‚Äù  
 
III

So Lord Howard past away with five ships of war that day,  
Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven;  
But Sir Richard bore in hand all his sick men from the land         
Very carefully and slow,  
Men of Bideford in Devon,  
And we laid them on the ballast down below:  
For we brought them all aboard,  
And they blest him in their pain, that they were not left to Spain,         
To the thumb-screw and the stake, for the glory of the Lord.  
 
IV

He had only a hundred seamen to work the ship and to fight,  
And he sailed away from Flores till the Spaniard came in sight,  
With his huge sea-castles heaving upon the weather bow.  
‚ÄúShall we fight or shall we fly?         
Good Sir Richard, tell us now,  
For to fight is but to die!  
There‚Äôll be little of us left by the time this sun be set.‚Äù  
And Sir Richard said again: ‚ÄúWe be all good Englishmen.  
Let us bang these dogs of Seville, the children of the devil,         
For I never turn‚Äôd my back upon Don or devil yet.‚Äù  
 
V

Sir Richard spoke and he laugh‚Äôd, and we roar‚Äôd a hurrah and so  
The little Revenge ran on sheer into the heart of the foe,  
With her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below;  
For half of their fleet to the right and half to the left were seen,         
And the little Revenge ran on thro‚Äô the long sea-lane between.  
 
VI

Thousands of their soldiers look‚Äôd down from their decks and laugh‚Äôd,  
Thousands of their seamen made mock at the mad little craft  
Running on and on, till delay‚Äôd  
By their mountain-like San Philip that, of fifteen hundred tons,        
And up-shadowing high above us with her yawning tiers of guns,  
Took the breath from our sails, and we stay‚Äôd.  
 
VII

And while now the great San Philip hung above us like a cloud  
Whence the thunderbolt will fall  
Long and loud,         45 
Four galleons drew away  
From the Spanish fleet that day.  
And two upon the larboard and two upon the starboard lay,  
And the battle-thunder broke from them all.  
 
VIII

But anon the great San Philip, she bethought herself and went,         
Having that within her womb that had left her ill content;  
And the rest they came aboard us, and they fought us hand to hand,  
For a dozen times they came with their pikes and musqueteers,  
And a dozen times we shook ‚Äôem off as a dog that shakes his ears  
When he leaps from the water to the land.           
IX

And the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer sea,  
But never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three.  
Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came,  
Ship after ship, the whole night long, with her battle-thunder and flame;  
Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and her shame.         
For some were sunk and many were shatter‚Äôd and so could fight us no more‚Äî  
God of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before?  
 
X

For he said, ‚ÄúFight on! fight on!‚Äù  
Tho‚Äô his vessel was all but a wreck;  
And it chanced that, when half of the short summer night was gone,         
With a grisly wound to be drest he had left the deck,  
But a bullet struck him that was dressing it suddenly dead,  
And himself he was wounded again in the side and the head,  
And he said, ‚ÄúFight on! fight on!‚Äù  
 
XI

And the night went down, and the sun smiled out far over the summer sea,        
And the Spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring;  
But they dared not touch us again, for they fear‚Äôd that we still could sting,  
So they watch‚Äôd what the end would be.  
And we had not fought them in vain,  
But in perilous plight were we,         
Seeing forty of our poor hundred were slain,  
And half of the rest of us maim‚Äôd for life  
In the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife;  
And the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and cold,  
And the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was all of it spent;
And the masts and the rigging were lying over the side;  
But Sir Richard cried in his English pride:  
‚ÄúWe have fought such a fight for a day and a night  
As may never be fought again!  
We have won great glory, my men!         
And a day less or more  
At sea or ashore,  
We die‚Äîdoes it matter when?  
Sink me the ship, Master Gunner‚Äîsink her, split her in twain!  
Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!‚Äù           
XII

And the gunner said, ‚ÄúAy, ay,‚Äù but the seamen made reply:  
‚ÄúWe have children, we have wives,  
And the Lord hath spared our lives.  
We will make the Spaniard promise, if we yield, to let us go;  
We shall live to fight again and to strike another blow.‚Äù         
And the lion there lay dying, and they yielded to the foe.  
 
XIII

And the stately Spanish men to their flagship bore him then,  
Where they laid him by the mast, old Sir Richard caught at last,  
And they praised him to his face with their courtly foreign grace;  
But he rose upon their decks, and he cried:         
‚ÄúI have fought for Queen and Faith like a valiant man and true;  
I have only done my duty as a man is bound to do.  
With a joyful spirit I Sir Richard Grenville die!‚Äù  
And he fell upon their decks, and he died.  
 
XIV

And they stared at the dead that had been so valiant and true,         
And had holden the power and glory of Spain so cheap  
That he dared her with one little ship and his English few;  
Was he devil or man? He was devil for aught they knew,  
But they sank his body with honor down into the deep.  
And they mann‚Äôd the Revenge with a swarthier alien crew,         
And away she sail‚Äôd with her loss and long‚Äôd for her own;  
When a wind from the lands they had ruin‚Äôd awoke from sleep,  
And the water began to heave and the weather to moan,  
And or ever that evening ended a great gale blew,  
And a wave like the wave that is raised by an earthquake grew,         
Till it smote on their hulls and their sails and their masts and their flags,  
And the whole sea plunged and fell on the shot-shatter‚Äôd navy of Spain,  
And the little Revenge herself went down by the island crags  
To be lost evermore in the main.",Ballad
31,David Herbert Lawrence,Ballad Of Another Ophelia,"Oh the green glimmer of apples in the orchard,
Lamps in a wash of rain!  
Oh the wet walk of my brown hen through the stackyard,
Oh tears on the window pane!  
 
Nothing now will ripen the bright green apples,
Full of disappointment and of rain,  
Brackish they will taste, of tears, when the yellow dapples
Of autumn tell the withered tale again.  
 
All round the yard it is cluck, my brown hen,  
Cluck, and the rain-wet wings,
Cluck, my marigold bird, and again  
Cluck for your yellow darlings.  
 
For the grey rat found the gold thirteen  
Huddled away in the dark,  
Flutter for a moment, oh the beast is quick and keen,
Extinct one yellow-fluffy spark.  
 
Once I had a lover bright like running water,  
Once his face was laughing like the sky;  
Open like the sky looking down in all its laughter  
On the buttercups, and the buttercups was I.
 
What, then, is there hidden in the skirts of all the blossom?
What is peeping from your wings, oh mother hen?  
‚ÄôTis the sun who asks the question, in a lovely haste for wisdom;
What a lovely haste for wisdom is in men!  
 
Yea, but it is cruel when undressed is all the blossom,
And her shift is lying white upon the floor,  
That a grey one, like a shadow, like a rat, a thief, a rain-storm,
Creeps upon her then and gathers in his store.  
 
Oh the grey garner that is full of half-grown apples,  
Oh the golden sparkles laid extinct!
And oh, behind the cloud-sheaves, like yellow autumn dapples,
Did you see the wicked sun that winked!",Ballad
32,Edwin Arlington Robinson,Ballad Of Broken Flutes,"In dreams I crossed a barren land, 
A land of ruin, far away; 
Around me hung on every hand 
A deathful stillness of decay; 
And silent, as in bleak dismay 
That song should thus forsaken be, 
On that forgotten ground there lay 
The broken flutes of Arcady. 

The forest that was all so grand 
When pipes and tabors had their sway 
Stood leafless now, a ghostly band 
Of skeletons in cold array. 
A lonely surge of ancient spray 
Told of an unforgetful sea, 
But iron blows had hushed for aye 
The broken flutes of Arcady. 

No more by summer breezes fanned, 
The place was desolate and gray; 
But still my dream was to command 
New life into that shrunken clay. 
I tried it. Yes, you scan to-day, 
With uncommiserating glee, 
The songs of one who strove to play 
The broken flutes of Arcady. 

ENVOY

So, Rock, I join the common fray, 
To fight where Mammon may decree; 
And leave, to crumble as they may, 
The broken flutes of Arcady.",Ballad
33,Edwin Arlington Robinson,Ballad Of A Ship,"Down by the flash of the restless water 
The dim White Ship like a white bird lay; 
Laughing at life and the world they sought her, 
And out she swung to the silvering bay. 
Then off they flew on their roystering way, 
And the keen moon fired the light foam flying 
Up from the flood where the faint stars play, 
And the bones of the brave in the wave are lying. 

'T was a king's fair son with a king's fair daughter, 
And full three hundred beside, they say, -- 
Revelling on for the lone, cold slaughter 
So soon to seize them and hide them for aye; 
But they danced and they drank and their souls grew gay, 
Nor ever they knew of a ghoul's eye spying 
Their splendor a flickering phantom to stray 
Where the bones of the brave in the wave are lying. 

Through the mist of a drunken dream they brought her 
(This wild white bird) for the sea-fiend's prey: 
The pitiless reef in his hard clutch caught her, 
And hurled her down where the dead men stay. 
A torturing silence of wan dismay -- 
Shrieks and curses of mad souls dying -- 
Then down they sank to slumber and sway 
Where the bones of the brave in the wave are lying. 

ENVOY

Prince, do you sleep to the sound alway 
Of the mournful surge and the sea-birds' crying? -- 
Or does love still shudder and steel still slay, 
Where the bones of the brave in the wave are lying?",Ballad
34,Robert Burns,John Barleycorn: A Ballad,"There was three kings unto the east, 
Three kings both great and high, 
And they hae sworn a solemn oath 
John Barleycorn should die. 
 
They took a plough and plough'd him down, 
Put clods upon his head, 
And they hae sworn a solemn oath 
John Barleycorn was dead. 
 
But the cheerful Spring came kindly on, 
And show'rs began to fall; 
John Barleycorn got up again, 
And sore surpris'd them all. 
 
The sultry suns of Summer came, 
And he grew thick and strong; 
His head weel arm'd wi' pointed spears, 
That no one should him wrong. 
 
The sober Autumn enter'd mild, 
When he grew wan and pale; 
His bending joints and drooping head 
Show'd he bagan to fail. 
 
His colour sicken'd more and more, 
He faded into age; 
And then his enemies began 
To show their deadly rage. 
 
They've taen a weapon, long and sharp, 
And cut him by the knee; 
Then tied him fast upon a cart, 
Like a rogue for forgerie. 
 
They laid him down upon his back, 
And cudgell'd him full sore; 
They hung him up before the storm, 
And turn'd him o'er and o'er. 
 
They filled up a darksome pit 
With water to the brim; 
They heaved in John Barleycorn, 
There let him sink or swim. 
 
They laid him out upon the floor, 
To work him further woe; 
And still, as signs of life appear'd, 
They toss'd him to and fro. 
 
They wasted, o'er a scorching flame, 
The marrow of his bones; 
But a miller us'd him worst of all, 
For he crush'd him between two stones. 
 
And they hae taen his very heart's blood, 
And drank it round and round; 
And still the more and more they drank, 
Their joy did more abound. 
 
John Barleycorn was a hero bold, 
Of noble enterprise; 
For if you do but taste his blood, 
'Twill make your courage rise. 
 
'Twill make a man forget his woe; 
'Twill heighten all his joy; 
'Twill make the widow's heart to sing, 
Tho' the tear were in her eye. 
 
Then let us toast John Barleycorn, 
Each man a glass in hand; 
And may his great posterity 
Ne'er fail in old Scotland!",Ballad
35,Robert Graves,A Ballad Of Nursery Rhyme,"Strawberries that in gardens grow
Are plump and juicy fine,
But sweeter far as wise men know
Spring from the woodland vine.

No need for bowl or silver spoon,
Sugar or spice or cream,
Has the wild berry plucked in June
Beside the trickling stream.

One such to melt at the tongue's root,
Confounding taste with scent,
Beats a full peck of garden fruit:
Which points my argument.

May sudden justice overtake
And snap the froward pen,
That old and palsied poets shake
Against the minds of men;

Blasphemers trusting to hold caught
In far-flung webs of ink
The utmost ends of human thought,
Till nothing's left to think.

But may the gift of heavenly peace
And glory for all time
Keep the boy Tom who tending geese
First made the nursery rhyme.

By the brookside one August day,
Using the sun for clock,
Tom whiled the languid hours away
Beside his scattering flock,

Carving with a sharp pointed stone
On a broad slab of slate
The famous lives of Jumping Joan,
Dan Fox and Greedy Kate;

Rhyming of wolves and bears and birds,
Spain, Scotland, Babylon,
That sister Kate might learn the words
To tell to Toddling John.

But Kate, who could not stay content
To learn her lesson pat,
New beauty to the rough lines lent
By changing this or that;

And she herself set fresh things down
In corners of her slate,
Of lambs and lanes and London Town.
God's blessing fall on Kate!

The baby loved the simple sound,
With jolly glee he shook,
And soon the lines grew smooth and round
Like pebbles in Tom's brook,

From mouth to mouth told and retold
By children sprawled at ease
Before the fire in winter's cold,
In June beneath tall trees;

Till though long lost are stone and slate,
Though the brook no more runs,
And dead long time are Tom, John, Kate,
Their sons and their sons' sons;

Yet, as when Time with stealthy tread
Lays the rich garden waste,
The woodland berry ripe and red
Fails not in scent or taste,

So these same rhymes shall still be told
To children yet unborn,
While false philosophy growing old
Fades and is killed by scorn.",Ballad
36,Geoffrey Chaucer,A Ballad Sent To King Richard,"Sometime this world was so steadfast and stable,
That man's word was held obligation;
And now it is so false and deceivable,
That word and work, as in conclusion,
Be nothing one; for turned up so down
Is all this world, through meed and wilfulness,
That all is lost for lack of steadfastness.

What makes this world to be so variable,
But lust that folk have in dissension?
For now-a-days a man is held unable
But if he can, by some collusion,
Do his neighbour wrong or oppression.
What causeth this but wilful wretchedness,
That all is lost for lack of steadfastness?

Truth is put down, reason is holden fable;
Virtue hath now no domination;
Pity exil'd, no wight is merciable;
Through covetise is blent discretion;
The worlde hath made permutation
From right to wrong, from truth to fickleness,
That all is lost for lack of steadfastness.

L'Envoy.

O Prince! desire to be honourable;
Cherish thy folk, and hate extortion;
Suffer nothing that may be reprovable
To thine estate, done in thy region;
Show forth the sword of castigation;
Dread God, do law, love thorough worthiness,
And wed thy folk again to steadfastness.",Ballad
37,Yevgeny Yevtushenko,Ballad About Drinking,"We had slaughtered a hundred white whales, 
civilization was quite forgotten, 
our lungs were burned out from smoking shag, 
but on sighting port we blew out our chests like barrels
and began to speak to one another politely, 
and with the noble goal of drinking
we went ashore from the schooner at Amderma.

In Amderma we walked like gods, 
swaggering along with our hands on our hips, 
and through the port our beards and sidewhiskers
kept their bearings on the pub, 
and passing girls and shellbacks
as well as all the local dogs
went along with us as escort.

But, clouding the whole planet, 
a notice hung in the shop: 'No Spirits! '
We looked at some sparkling wine from the Don
as if it were feeble fruit juice, 
and through our agonized yearning
we realized-it wouldn't work.

Now who could have drunk our spirits, our vodka? 
It's dreadful the way people drink-simply ruinous.
But skinny as a skeleton, Petka Markovsky from Odessa, 
as it always happens with him, 
suddenly disappeared somewhere
giving a secretive 'Sh-sshh! '

And shortly afterward, with much clinking, 
he turned up with a huge cardboard box, 
already slightly merry, 
and it was a sweet clinking the box made
as we woke up to the fact: 'There she is! She's apples! '
and Markovsky gave us the wink: 'She's right! '

We made a splash, waving to everyone-
Chartered a deluxe room in the hotel
and sat down as we were on the bed.
Cords flew off the box
and there, in the glittering columns of the bottles, 
bulging, stern, cosy, 
absolutely hygienic-
triple-distilled eau de cologne stood before us! 

And Markovsky rose, lifting his glass, 
pulled down his seaman's jacket, 
and began: 'I'd like to say something...'
'Then say it! ' everyone began to shout.
But before anything else
they wanted to wet their whistles.

Markovsky said: 'Come on-let's have a swig! 
The doctor told me eau de cologne
is the best thing to keep the wrinkles away.
Let them judge us! -We don't give a damn! 
We used to drink all sorts of wine! 
When we were in Germany
we filled the radiators of our tanks
with wine from the Mosel.

We don't need consumer goods! 
We need the wind, the sky! 
Old mates, listen to this
in our souls, as though in the safe deposit: 
We have the sea, our mothers and young brothers-
All the rest...is rubbish! '

Bestriding the earth like a giant, 
Markovsky stood with a glass in his hand
that held the foaming seas.
The skipper observed: 'Everything is shipshape! '
and only the boatswain sobbed like a child: 
'But my mother is dead...'

And we all began to burst into tears, 
quite easily, quite shamelessly, 
as if in the midst of our own families, 
mourning with bitter tears
at first for the boatswain's mother, 
and afterward simply for ourselves.

Already a rueful notice hung in the chemist's shop-
'No Triple Eau de Cologne'-
but eight of us sea wolves
sobbed over almost all of Russia! 
And in our sobs we reeked
like eight barbershops.

Tears, like squalls, 
swept away heaps of false values, 
of puffed-up names, 
and quietly remaining inside us
was only the sea, our mothers and young brothers-
even the mother who was dead...

I wept as though I was being set free, 
I wept as if I was being born anew, 
a different person from what I'd been, 
and before God and before myself, 
like the tears of those drunken whalemen, 
my soul was pure.",Ballad
38,Oscar Wilde,The Ballad Of Reading Gaol (Version II),"Version II

He did not wear his scarlet coat, 
For blood and wine are red, 
And blood and wine were on his hands 
When they found him with the dead, 
The poor dead woman whom he loved, 
And murdered in her bed. 


He walked amongst the Trial Men 
In a suit of shabby gray; 
A cricket cap was on his head, 
And his step seemed light and gay; 
But I never saw a man who looked 
So wistfully at the day. 


I never saw a man who looked 
With such a wistful eye 
Upon that little tent of blue 
Which prisoners call the sky, 
And at every drifting cloud that went 
With sails of silver by. 


I walked, with other souls in pain, 
Within another ring, 
And was wondering if the man had done 
A great or little thing, 
When a voice behind me whispered low, 
'That fellow's got to swing.' 


Dear Christ! the very prison walls 
Suddenly seemed to reel, 
And the sky above my head became 
Like a casque of scorching steel; 
And, though I was a soul in pain, 
My pain I could not feel. 


I only knew what haunted thought 
Quickened his step, and why 
He looked upon the garish day 
With such a wistful eye; 
The man had killed the thing he loved, 
And so he had to die. 


Yet each man kills the thing he loves, 
By each let this be heard, 
Some do it with a bitter look, 
Some with a flattering word, 
The coward does it with a kiss, 
The brave man with a sword! 


Some kill their love when they are young, 
And some when they are old; 
Some strangle with the hands of Lust, 
Some with the hands of Gold: 
The kindest use a knife, because 
The dead so soon grow cold. 


Some love too little, some too long, 
Some sell, and others buy; 
Some do the deed with many tears, 
And some without a sigh: 
For each man kills the thing he loves, 
Yet each man does not die. 


He does not die a death of shame 
On a day of dark disgrace, 
Nor have a noose about his neck, 
Nor a cloth upon his face, 
Nor drop feet foremost through the floor 
Into an empty space. 


He does not sit with silent men 
Who watch him night and day; 
Who watch him when he tries to weep, 
And when he tries to pray; 
Who watch him lest himself should rob 
The prison of its prey. 


He does not wake at dawn to see 
Dread figures throng his room, 
The shivering Chaplain robed in white, 
The Sheriff stern with gloom, 
And the Governor all in shiny black, 
With the yellow face of Doom. 


He does not rise in piteous haste 
To put on convict-clothes, 
While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes 
Each new and nerve-twitched pose, 
Fingering a watch whose little ticks 
Are like horrible hammer-blows. 


He does not feel that sickening thirst 
That sands one's throat, before 
The hangman with his gardener's gloves 
Comes through the padded door, 
And binds one with three leathern thongs, 
That the throat may thirst no more. 


He does not bend his head to hear 
The Burial Office read, 
Nor, while the anguish of his soul 
Tells him he is not dead, 
Cross his own coffin, as he moves 
Into the hideous shed. 


He does not stare upon the air 
Through a little roof of glass: 
He does not pray with lips of clay 
For his agony to pass; 
Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek 
The kiss of Caiaphas. 


II

Six weeks the guardsman walked the yard, 
In the suit of shabby gray: 
His cricket cap was on his head, 
And his step was light and gay, 
But I never saw a man who looked 
So wistfully at the day. 


I never saw a man who looked 
With such a wistful eye 
Upon that little tent of blue 
Which prisoners call the sky, 
And at every wandering cloud that trailed 
Its ravelled fleeces by. 


He did not wring his hands, as do 
Those witless men who dare 
To try to rear the changeling Hope 
In the cave of black Despair: 
He only looked upon the sun, 
And drank the morning air. 


He did not wring his hands nor weep, 
Nor did he peek or pine, 
But he drank the air as though it held 
Some healthful anodyne; 
With open mouth he drank the sun 
As though it had been wine! 


And I and all the souls in pain, 
Who tramped the other ring, 
Forgot if we ourselves had done 
A great or little thing, 
And watched with gaze of dull amaze 
The man who had to swing. 


For strange it was to see him pass 
With a step so light and gay, 
And strange it was to see him look 
So wistfully at the day, 
And strange it was to think that he 
Had such a debt to pay. 


The oak and elm have pleasant leaves 
That in the spring-time shoot: 
But grim to see is the gallows-tree, 
With its alder-bitten root, 
And, green or dry, a man must die 
Before it bears its fruit! 


The loftiest place is the seat of grace 
For which all worldlings try: 
But who would stand in hempen band 
Upon a scaffold high, 
And through a murderer's collar take 
His last look at the sky? 


It is sweet to dance to violins 
When Love and Life are fair: 
To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes 
Is delicate and rare: 
But it is not sweet with nimble feet 
To dance upon the air! 


So with curious eyes and sick surmise 
We watched him day by day, 
And wondered if each one of us 
Would end the self-same way, 
For none can tell to what red Hell 
His sightless soul may stray. 


At last the dead man walked no more 
Amongst the Trial Men, 
And I knew that he was standing up 
In the black dock's dreadful pen, 
And that never would I see his face 
For weal or woe again. 


Like two doomed ships that pass in storm 
We had crossed each other's way: 
But we made no sign, we said no word, 
We had no word to say; 
For we did not meet in the holy night, 
But in the shameful day. 


A prison wall was round us both, 
Two outcast men we were: 
The world had thrust us from its heart, 
And God from out His care: 
And the iron gin that waits for Sin 
Had caught us in its snare. 


III

In Debtors' Yard the stones are hard, 
And the dripping wall is high, 
So it was there he took the air 
Beneath the leaden sky, 
And by each side a warder walked, 
For fear the man might die. 


Or else he sat with those who watched 
His anguish night and day; 
Who watched him when he rose to weep, 
And when he crouched to pray; 
Who watched him lest himself should rob 
Their scaffold of its prey. 


The Governor was strong upon 
The Regulations Act: 
The Doctor said that Death was but 
A scientific fact: 
And twice a day the Chaplain called, 
And left a little tract. 


And twice a day he smoked his pipe, 
And drank his quart of beer: 
His soul was resolute, and held 
No hiding-place for fear; 
He often said that he was glad 
The hangman's day was near. 


But why he said so strange a thing 
No warder dared to ask: 
For he to whom a watcher's doom 
Is given as his task, 
Must set a lock upon his lips, 
And make his face a mask. 


Or else he might be moved, and try 
To comfort or console: 
And what should Human Pity do 
Pent up in Murderers' Hole? 
What word of grace in such a place 
Could help a brother's soul? 


With slouch and swing around the ring 
We trod the Fools' Parade! 
We did not care: we knew we were 
The Devils' Own Brigade: 
And shaven head and feet of lead 
Make a merry masquerade. 


We tore the tarry rope to shreds 
With blunt and bleeding nails; 
We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors, 
And cleaned the shining rails: 
And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank, 
And clattered with the pails. 


We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones, 
We turned the dusty drill: 
We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns, 
And sweated on the mill: 
But in the heart of every man 
Terror was lying still. 


So still it lay that every day 
Crawled like a weed-clogged wave: 
And we forgot the bitter lot 
That waits for fool and knave, 
Till once, as we tramped in from work, 
We passed an open grave. 


With yawning mouth the horrid hole 
Gaped for a living thing; 
The very mud cried out for blood 
To the thirsty asphalte ring: 
And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair 
The fellow had to swing. 


Right in we went, with soul intent 
On Death and Dread and Doom: 
The hangman, with his little bag, 
Went shuffling through the gloom: 
And I trembled as I groped my way 
Into my numbered tomb. 


That night the empty corridors 
Were full of forms of Fear, 
And up and down the iron town 
Stole feet we could not hear, 
And through the bars that hide the stars 
White faces seemed to peer. 


He lay as one who lies and dreams 
In a pleasant meadow-land, 
The watchers watched him as he slept, 
And could not understand 
How one could sleep so sweet a sleep 
With a hangman close at hand. 


But there is no sleep when men must weep 
Who never yet have wept: 
So we- the fool, the fraud, the knave- 
That endless vigil kept, 
And through each brain on hands of pain 
Another's terror crept. 


Alas! it is a fearful thing 
To feel another's guilt! 
For, right within, the sword of Sin 
Pierced to its poisoned hilt, 
And as molten lead were the tears we shed 
For the blood we had not spilt. 


The warders with their shoes of felt 
Crept by each padlocked door, 
And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe, 
Gray figures on the floor, 
And wondered why men knelt to pray 
Who never prayed before. 


All through the night we knelt and prayed, 
Mad mourners of a corse! 
The troubled plumes of midnight shook 
Like the plumes upon a hearse: 
And as bitter wine upon a sponge 
Was the savour of Remorse. 


The gray cock crew, the red cock crew, 
But never came the day: 
And crooked shapes of Terror crouched, 
In the corners where we lay: 
And each evil sprite that walks by night 
Before us seemed to play. 


They glided past, the glided fast, 
Like travellers through a mist: 
They mocked the moon in a rigadoon 
Of delicate turn and twist, 
And with formal pace and loathsome grace 
The phantoms kept their tryst. 


With mop and mow, we saw them go, 
Slim shadows hand in hand: 
About, about, in ghostly rout 
They trod a saraband: 
And the damned grotesques made arabesques, 
Like the wind upon the sand! 


With the pirouettes of marionettes, 
They tripped on pointed tread: 
But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear, 
As their grisly masque they led, 
And loud they sang, and long they sang, 
For they sang to wake the dead. 


'Oho! ' they cried, 'the world is wide, 
But fettered limbs go lame! 
And once, or twice, to throw the dice 
Is a gentlemanly game, 
But he does not win who plays with Sin 
In the secret House of Shame.' 


No things of air these antics were, 
That frolicked with such glee: 
To men whose lives were held in gyves, 
And whose feet might not go free, 
Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things, 
Most terrible to see. 


Around, around, they waltzed and wound; 
Some wheeled in smirking pairs; 
With the mincing step of a demirep 
Some sidled up the stairs: 
And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer, 
Each helped us at our prayers. 


The morning wind began to moan, 
But still the night went on: 
Through its giant loom the web of gloom 
Crept till each thread was spun: 
And, as we prayed, we grew afraid 
Of the Justice of the Sun. 


The moaning wind went wandering round 
The weeping prison wall: 
Till like a wheel of turning steel 
We felt the minutes crawl: 
O moaning wind! what had we done 
To have such a seneschal? 


At last I saw the shadowed bars, 
Like a lattice wrought in lead, 
Move right across the whitewashed wall 
That faced my three-plank bed, 
And I knew that somewhere in the world 
God's dreadful dawn was red. 


At six o'clock we cleaned our cells, 
At seven all was still, 
But the sough and swing of a mighty wing 
The prison seemed to fill, 
For the Lord of Death with icy breath 
Had entered in to kill. 


He did not pass in purple pomp, 
Nor ride a moon-white steed. 
Three yards of cord and a sliding board 
Are all the gallows' need: 
So with rope of shame the Herald came 
To do the secret deed. 


We were as men who through a fen 
Of filthy darkness grope: 
We did not dare to breathe a prayer, 
Or to give our anguish scope: 
Something was dead in each of us, 
And what was dead was Hope. 


For Man's grim Justice goes its way 
And will not swerve aside: 
It slays the weak, it slays the strong, 
It has a deadly stride: 
With iron heel it slays the strong 
The monstrous parricide! 


We waited for the stroke of eight: 
Each tongue was thick with thirst: 
For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate 
That makes a man accursed, 
And Fate will use a running noose 
For the best man and the worst. 


We had no other thing to do, 
Save to wait for the sign to come: 
So, like things of stone in a valley lone, 
Quiet we sat and dumb: 
But each man's heart beat thick and quick, 
Like a madman on a drum! 


With sudden shock the prison-clock 
Smote on the shivering air, 
And from all the gaol rose up a wail 
Of impotent despair, 
Like the sound the frightened marshes hear 
From some leper in his lair. 


And as one sees most fearful things 
In the crystal of a dream, 
We saw the greasy hempen rope 
Hooked to the blackened beam, 
And heard the prayer the hangman's snare 
Strangled into a scream. 


And all the woe that moved him so 
That he gave that bitter cry, 
And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats, 
None knew so well as I: 
For he who lives more lives than one 
More deaths that one must die. 


IV

There is no chapel on the day 
On which they hang a man: 
The Chaplain's heart is far too sick, 
Or his face is far too wan, 
Or there is that written in his eyes 
Which none should look upon. 


So they kept us close till nigh on noon, 
And then they rang the bell, 
And the warders with their jingling keys 
Opened each listening cell, 
And down the iron stair we tramped, 
Each from his separate Hell. 


Out into God's sweet air we went, 
But not in wonted way, 
For this man's face was white with fear, 
And that man's face was gray, 
And I never saw sad men who looked 
So wistfully at the day. 


I never saw sad men who looked 
With such a wistful eye 
Upon that little tent of blue 
We prisoners called the sky, 
And at every happy cloud that passed 
In such strange freedom by. 


But there were those amongst us all 
Who walked with downcast head, 
And knew that, had each got his due, 
They should have died instead: 
He had but killed a thing that lived, 
Whilst they had killed the dead. 


For he who sins a second time 
Wakes a dead soul to pain, 
And draws it from its spotted shroud 
And makes it bleed again, 
And makes it bleed great gouts of blood, 
And makes it bleed in vain! 


Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb 
With crooked arrows starred, 
Silently we went round and round 
The slippery asphalte yard; 
Silently we went round and round, 
And no man spoke a word. 


Silently we went round and round, 
And through each hollow mind 
The Memory of dreadful things 
Rushed like a dreadful wind, 
And Horror stalked before each man, 
And Terror crept behind. 


The warders strutted up and down, 
And watched their herd of brutes, 
Their uniforms were spick and span, 
And they wore their Sunday suits, 
But we knew the work they had been at, 
By the quicklime on their boots. 


For where a grave had opened wide, 
There was no grave at all: 
Only a stretch of mud and sand 
By the hideous prison-wall, 
And a little heap of burning lime, 
That the man should have his pall. 


For he has a pall, this wretched man, 
Such as few men can claim: 
Deep down below a prison-yard, 
Naked, for greater shame, 
He lies, with fetters on each foot, 
Wrapt in a sheet of flame! 


And all the while the burning lime 
Eats flesh and bone away, 
It eats the brittle bones by night, 
And the soft flesh by day, 
It eats the flesh and bone by turns, 
But it eats the heart alway. 


For three long years they will not sow 
Or root or seedling there: 
For three long years the unblessed spot 
Will sterile be and bare, 
And look upon the wondering sky 
With unreproachful stare. 


They think a murderer's heart would taint 
Each simple seed they sow. 
It is not true! God's kindly earth 
Is kindlier than men know, 
And the red rose would but glow more red, 
The white rose whiter blow. 


Out of his mouth a red, red rose! 
Out of his heart a white! 
For who can say by what strange way, 
Christ brings His will to light, 
Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore 
Bloomed in the great Pope's sight? 


But neither milk-white rose nor red 
May bloom in prison air; 
The shard, the pebble, and the flint, 
Are what they give us there: 
For flowers have been known to heal 
A common man's despair. 


So never will wine-red rose or white, 
Petal by petal, fall 
On that stretch of mud and sand that lies 
By the hideous prison-wall, 
To tell the men who tramp the yard 
That God's Son died for all. 


Yet though the hideous prison-wall 
Still hems him round and round, 
And a spirit may not walk by night 
That is with fetters bound, 
And a spirit may but weep that lies 
In such unholy ground, 


He is at peace- this wretched man- 
At peace, or will be soon: 
There is no thing to make him mad, 
Nor does Terror walk at noon, 
For the lampless Earth in which he lies 
Has neither Sun nor Moon. 


They hanged him as a beast is hanged: 
They did not even toll 
A requiem that might have brought 
Rest to his startled soul, 
But hurriedly they took him out, 
And hid him in a hole. 


The warders stripped him of his clothes, 
And gave him to the flies: 
They mocked the swollen purple throat, 
And the stark and staring eyes: 
And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud 
In which the convict lies. 


The Chaplain would not kneel to pray 
By his dishonoured grave: 
Nor mark it with that blessed Cross 
That Christ for sinners gave, 
Because the man was one of those 
Whom Christ came down to save. 


Yet all is well; he has but passed 
To Life's appointed bourne: 
And alien tears will fill for him 
Pity's long-broken urn, 
For his mourners be outcast men, 
And outcasts always mourn. 


V

I know not whether Laws be right, 
Or whether Laws be wrong; 
All that we know who lie in gaol 
Is that the wall is strong; 
And that each day is like a year, 
A year whose days are long. 


But this I know, that every Law 
That men have made for Man, 
Since first Man took His brother's life, 
And the sad world began, 
But straws the wheat and saves the chaff 
With a most evil fan. 


This too I know- and wise it were 
If each could know the same- 
That every prison that men build 
Is built with bricks of shame, 
And bound with bars lest Christ should see 
How men their brothers maim. 


With bars they blur the gracious moon, 
And blind the goodly sun: 
And the do well to hide their Hell, 
For in it things are done 
That Son of things nor son of Man 
Ever should look upon! 


The vilest deeds like poison weeds 
Bloom well in prison-air: 
It is only what is good in Man 
That wastes and withers there: 
Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate, 
And the warder is Despair. 


For they starve the little frightened child 
Till it weeps both night and day: 
And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool, 
And gibe the old and gray, 
And some grow mad, and all grow bad, 
And none a word may say. 


Each narrow cell in which we dwell 
Is a foul and dark latrine, 
And the fetid breath of living Death 
Chokes up each grated screen, 
And all, but Lust, is turned to dust 
In Humanity's machine. 


The brackish water that we drink 
Creeps with a loathsome slime, 
And the bitter bread they weigh in scales 
Is full of chalk and lime, 
And Sleep will not lie down, but walks 
Wild-eyed, and cries to Time. 


But though lean Hunger and green Thirst 
Like asp with adder fight, 
We have little care of prison fare, 
For what chills and kills outright 
Is that every stone one lifts by day 
Becomes one's heart by night. 


With midnight always in one's heart, 
And twilight in one's cell, 
We turn the crank, or tear the rope, 
Each in his separate Hell, 
And the silence is more awful far 
Than the sound of a brazen bell. 


And never a human voice comes near 
To speak a gentle word: 
And the eye that watches through the door 
Is pitiless and hard: 
And by all forgot, we rot and rot, 
With soul and body marred. 


And thus we rust Life's iron chain 
Degraded and alone: 
And some men curse, and some men weep, 
And some men make no moan: 
But God's eternal Laws are kind 
And break the heart of stone. 


And every human heart that breaks, 
In prison-cell or yard, 
Is as that broken box that gave 
Its treasure to the Lord, 
And filled the unclean leper's house 
With the scent of costliest nard. 


Ah! happy they whose hearts can break 
And peace of pardon win! 
How else may man make straight his plan 
And cleanse his soul from Sin? 
How else but through a broken heart 
May Lord Christ enter in? 


And he of the swollen purple throat, 
And the stark and staring eyes, 
Waits for the holy hands that took 
The Thief to Paradise; 
And a broken and a contrite heart 
The Lord will not despise. 


The man in red who reads the Law 
Gave him three weeks of life, 
Three little weeks in which to heal 
His soul of his soul's strife, 
And cleanse from every blot of blood 
The hand that held the knife. 


And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand, 
The hand that held the steel: 
For only blood can wipe out blood, 
And only tears can heal: 
And the crimson stain that was of Cain 
Became Christ's snow-white seal. 


VI

In Reading gaol by Reading town 
There is a pit of shame, 
And in it lies a wretched man 
Eaten by teeth of flame, 
In a burning winding-sheet he lies, 
And his grave has got no name. 


And there, till Christ call forth the dead, 
In silence let him lie: 
No need to waste the foolish tear, 
Or heave the windy sigh: 
The man had killed the thing he loved, 
And so he had to die. 


And all men kill the thing they love, 
By all let this be heard, 
Some do it with a bitter look, 
Some with a flattering word, 
The coward does it with a kiss, 
The brave man with a sword!",Ballad
39,Ezra Pound,A Villonaud: Ballad Of The Gibbet,"SCENE: 'En ce bourdel ou tenons nostre estat.'

It being remembered that there were six of us with Master Villon, when
that expecting presently lo be hanged he writ a ballad whereof ye know:

‚ÄòFreres humains qui apres nous vivez.'

Drink ye a skoal for the gallows tree!
Francois and Margot and thee and me,
Drink we the comrades merrily
That said us, 'Till then' for the gallows tree!

Fat Pierre with the hook gauche-main,
Thomas Larron 'Ear-the-less',
Tybalde and that armouress
Who gave this poignard its premier stain
Pinning the Guise that had been fain
To make him a mate of the 'Haulte Noblesse'
And bade her be out with ill address
As a fool that mocketh his drue's disdeign.

Drink we a skoal for the gallows tree!
Francois and Margot and thee and me,
Drink we to Marienne Ydole,
That hell brenn not her o'er cruelly.

Drink we the lusty robbers twain,
Black is the pitch o' their wedding dress,
Lips shrunk back for the wind's caress
As lips shrink back when we feel the strain

Of love that loveth in hell's disdeign,
And sense the teeth through the lips that press
'Gainst our lips for the soul's distress
That striveth to ours across the pain.

Drink we skoal to the gallows tree!
Francois and Margot and thee and me,
For Jehan and Raoul de Vallerie
Whose frames have the night and its winds in fee.

Maturin, Guillaume, Jacques d'Allmain,
Culdou lacking a coat to bless
One lean moiety of his nakedness
That plundered St. Hubert back o' the fane:
Aie! the lean bare tree is widowed again
For Michault le Borgne that would confess
In 'faith and troth' to a traitoress,
'Which of his brothers had he slain?'

But drink we skoal to the gallows tree!
Francois and Margot and thee and me:

These that we loved shall God love less
And smite always at their faibleness?

Skoal!! to the gallows! and then pray we:
God damn his hell out speedily
And bring their souls to his 'Haulte Citee'.",Ballad
40,Gilbert Keith Chesterton,The Ballad Of The White Horse,"DEDICATION 

Of great limbs gone to chaos,
A great face turned to night--
Why bend above a shapeless shroud
Seeking in such archaic cloud
Sight of strong lords and light?

Where seven sunken Englands
Lie buried one by one,
Why should one idle spade, I wonder,
Shake up the dust of thanes like thunder
To smoke and choke the sun?

In cloud of clay so cast to heaven
What shape shall man discern?
These lords may light the mystery
Of mastery or victory,
And these ride high in history,
But these shall not return.

Gored on the Norman gonfalon
The Golden Dragon died:
We shall not wake with ballad strings 
The good time of the smaller things,
We shall not see the holy kings
Ride down by Severn side.

Stiff, strange, and quaintly coloured
As the broidery of Bayeux
The England of that dawn remains,
And this of Alfred and the Danes
Seems like the tales a whole tribe feigns
Too English to be true.

Of a good king on an island
That ruled once on a time;
And as he walked by an apple tree
There came green devils out of the sea
With sea-plants trailing heavily
And tracks of opal slime.

Yet Alfred is no fairy tale;
His days as our days ran,
He also looked forth for an hour
On peopled plains and skies that lower,
From those few windows in the tower
That is the head of a man.

But who shall look from Alfred's hood
Or breathe his breath alive?
His century like a small dark cloud
Drifts far; it is an eyeless crowd,
Where the tortured trumpets scream aloud
And the dense arrows drive.

Lady, by one light only
We look from Alfred's eyes,
We know he saw athwart the wreck
The sign that hangs about your neck,
Where One more than Melchizedek
Is dead and never dies.

Therefore I bring these rhymes to you
Who brought the cross to me,
Since on you flaming without flaw
I saw the sign that Guthrum saw
When he let break his ships of awe,
And laid peace on the sea.

Do you remember when we went
Under a dragon moon,
And `mid volcanic tints of night
Walked where they fought the unknown fight
And saw black trees on the battle-height,
Black thorn on Ethandune?
And I thought, ""I will go with you,
As man with God has gone,
And wander with a wandering star,
The wandering heart of things that are,
The fiery cross of love and war
That like yourself, goes on.""

O go you onward; where you are
Shall honour and laughter be,
Past purpled forest and pearled foam,
God's winged pavilion free to roam,
Your face, that is a wandering home,
A flying home for me.

Ride through the silent earthquake lands,
Wide as a waste is wide,
Across these days like deserts, when
Pride and a little scratching pen
Have dried and split the hearts of men,
Heart of the heroes, ride.

Up through an empty house of stars,
Being what heart you are,
Up the inhuman steeps of space
As on a staircase go in grace,
Carrying the firelight on your face
Beyond the loneliest star.

Take these; in memory of the hour 
We strayed a space from home
And saw the smoke-hued hamlets, quaint
With Westland king and Westland saint,
And watched the western glory faint
Along the road to Frome.




BOOK I THE VISION OF THE KING


Before the gods that made the gods
Had seen their sunrise pass,
The White Horse of the White Horse Vale
Was cut out of the grass.

Before the gods that made the gods
Had drunk at dawn their fill,
The White Horse of the White Horse Vale
Was hoary on the hill.

Age beyond age on British land,
Aeons on aeons gone,
Was peace and war in western hills,
And the White Horse looked on.

For the White Horse knew England
When there was none to know;
He saw the first oar break or bend,
He saw heaven fall and the world end,
O God, how long ago.

For the end of the world was long ago,
And all we dwell to-day
As children of some second birth,
Like a strange people left on earth
After a judgment day.

For the end of the world was long ago,
When the ends of the world waxed free,
When Rome was sunk in a waste of slaves,
And the sun drowned in the sea.

When Caesar's sun fell out of the sky
And whoso hearkened right
Could only hear the plunging
Of the nations in the night.

When the ends of the earth came marching in
To torch and cresset gleam.
And the roads of the world that lead to Rome
Were filled with faces that moved like foam,
Like faces in a dream.

And men rode out of the eastern lands,
Broad river and burning plain;
Trees that are Titan flowers to see,
And tiger skies, striped horribly,
With tints of tropic rain.

Where Ind's enamelled peaks arise
Around that inmost one,
Where ancient eagles on its brink,
Vast as archangels, gather and drink
The sacrament of the sun.

And men brake out of the northern lands,
Enormous lands alone,
Where a spell is laid upon life and lust
And the rain is changed to a silver dust
And the sea to a great green stone.

And a Shape that moveth murkily
In mirrors of ice and night,
Hath blanched with fear all beasts and birds,
As death and a shock of evil words
Blast a man's hair with white.

And the cry of the palms and the purple moons,
Or the cry of the frost and foam,
Swept ever around an inmost place,
And the din of distant race on race
Cried and replied round Rome.

And there was death on the Emperor
And night upon the Pope:
And Alfred, hiding in deep grass,
Hardened his heart with hope.

A sea-folk blinder than the sea
Broke all about his land,
But Alfred up against them bare
And gripped the ground and grasped the air,
Staggered, and strove to stand.

He bent them back with spear and spade,
With desperate dyke and wall,
With foemen leaning on his shield
And roaring on him when he reeled;
And no help came at all.

He broke them with a broken sword
A little towards the sea,
And for one hour of panting peace,
Ringed with a roar that would not cease,
With golden crown and girded fleece
Made laws under a tree.


The Northmen came about our land
A Christless chivalry:
Who knew not of the arch or pen,
Great, beautiful half-witted men
From the sunrise and the sea.

Misshapen ships stood on the deep
Full of strange gold and fire,
And hairy men, as huge as sin
With horned heads, came wading in
Through the long, low sea-mire.

Our towns were shaken of tall kings
With scarlet beards like blood:
The world turned empty where they trod,
They took the kindly cross of God
And cut it up for wood.

Their souls were drifting as the sea,
And all good towns and lands
They only saw with heavy eyes,
And broke with heavy hands,

Their gods were sadder than the sea,
Gods of a wandering will,
Who cried for blood like beasts at night,
Sadly, from hill to hill.

They seemed as trees walking the earth,
As witless and as tall,
Yet they took hold upon the heavens
And no help came at all.

They bred like birds in English woods,
They rooted like the rose,
When Alfred came to Athelney
To hide him from their bows

There was not English armour left,
Nor any English thing,
When Alfred came to Athelney
To be an English king.

For earthquake swallowing earthquake
Uprent the Wessex tree;
The whirlpool of the pagan sway
Had swirled his sires as sticks away
When a flood smites the sea.

And the great kings of Wessex
Wearied and sank in gore,
And even their ghosts in that great stress
Grew greyer and greyer, less and less,
With the lords that died in Lyonesse
And the king that comes no more.

And the God of the Golden Dragon
Was dumb upon his throne,
And the lord of the Golden Dragon
Ran in the woods alone.

And if ever he climbed the crest of luck
And set the flag before,
Returning as a wheel returns,
Came ruin and the rain that burns,
And all began once more.

And naught was left King Alfred
But shameful tears of rage,
In the island in the river
In the end of all his age.

In the island in the river
He was broken to his knee:
And he read, writ with an iron pen,
That God had wearied of Wessex men
And given their country, field and fen,
To the devils of the sea.

And he saw in a little picture,
Tiny and far away,
His mother sitting in Egbert's hall,
And a book she showed him, very small,
Where a sapphire Mary sat in stall
With a golden Christ at play.

It was wrought in the monk's slow manner,
From silver and sanguine shell,
Where the scenes are little and terrible,
Keyholes of heaven and hell.

In the river island of Athelney,
With the river running past,
In colours of such simple creed
All things sprang at him, sun and weed,
Till the grass grew to be grass indeed
And the tree was a tree at last.

Fearfully plain the flowers grew,
Like the child's book to read,
Or like a friend's face seen in a glass;
He looked; and there Our Lady was,
She stood and stroked the tall live grass
As a man strokes his steed.

Her face was like an open word
When brave men speak and choose,
The very colours of her coat
Were better than good news.

She spoke not, nor turned not,
Nor any sign she cast,
Only she stood up straight and free,
Between the flowers in Athelney,
And the river running past.

One dim ancestral jewel hung
On his ruined armour grey,
He rent and cast it at her feet:
Where, after centuries, with slow feet,
Men came from hall and school and street
And found it where it lay.

""Mother of God,"" the wanderer said,
""I am but a common king,
Nor will I ask what saints may ask,
To see a secret thing.

""The gates of heaven are fearful gates
Worse than the gates of hell;
Not I would break the splendours barred
Or seek to know the thing they guard,
Which is too good to tell.

""But for this earth most pitiful,
This little land I know,
If that which is for ever is,
Or if our hearts shall break with bliss,
Seeing the stranger go?

""When our last bow is broken, Queen,
And our last javelin cast,
Under some sad, green evening sky,
Holding a ruined cross on high,
Under warm westland grass to lie,
Shall we come home at last?""

And a voice came human but high up,
Like a cottage climbed among
The clouds; or a serf of hut and croft
That sits by his hovel fire as oft,
But hears on his old bare roof aloft
A belfry burst in song.

""The gates of heaven are lightly locked,
We do not guard our gain,
The heaviest hind may easily
Come silently and suddenly
Upon me in a lane.

""And any little maid that walks
In good thoughts apart,
May break the guard of the Three Kings
And see the dear and dreadful things
I hid within my heart.

""The meanest man in grey fields gone
Behind the set of sun,
Heareth between star and other star,
Through the door of the darkness fallen ajar,
The council, eldest of things that are,
The talk of the Three in One.

""The gates of heaven are lightly locked,
We do not guard our gold,
Men may uproot where worlds begin,
Or read the name of the nameless sin;
But if he fail or if he win
To no good man is told.

""The men of the East may spell the stars,
And times and triumphs mark,
But the men signed of the cross of Christ
Go gaily in the dark.

""The men of the East may search the scrolls
For sure fates and fame,
But the men that drink the blood of God
Go singing to their shame.

""The wise men know what wicked things
Are written on the sky,
They trim sad lamps, they touch sad strings,
Hearing the heavy purple wings,
Where the forgotten seraph kings
Still plot how God shall die.

""The wise men know all evil things
Under the twisted trees,
Where the perverse in pleasure pine
And men are weary of green wine
And sick of crimson seas.

""But you and all the kind of Christ
Are ignorant and brave,
And you have wars you hardly win
And souls you hardly save.

""I tell you naught for your comfort,
Yea, naught for your desire,
Save that the sky grows darker yet
And the sea rises higher.

""Night shall be thrice night over you,
And heaven an iron cope.
Do you have joy without a cause,
Yea, faith without a hope?""

Even as she spoke she was not,
Nor any word said he,
He only heard, still as he stood
Under the old night's nodding hood,
The sea-folk breaking down the wood
Like a high tide from sea.

He only heard the heathen men,
Whose eyes are blue and bleak,
Singing about some cruel thing
Done by a great and smiling king
In daylight on a deck.

He only heard the heathen men,
Whose eyes are blue and blind,
Singing what shameful things are done
Between the sunlit sea and the sun
When the land is left behind.




BOOK II THE GATHERING OF THE CHIEFS


Up across windy wastes and up
Went Alfred over the shaws,
Shaken of the joy of giants,
The joy without a cause.

In the slopes away to the western bays,
Where blows not ever a tree,
He washed his soul in the west wind
And his body in the sea.

And he set to rhyme his ale-measures,
And he sang aloud his laws,
Because of the joy of the giants,
The joy without a cause. 

The King went gathering Wessex men,
As grain out of the chaff
The few that were alive to die,
Laughing, as littered skulls that lie
After lost battles turn to the sky
An everlasting laugh.

The King went gathering Christian men,
As wheat out of the husk;
Eldred, the Franklin by the sea,
And Mark, the man from Italy,
And Colan of the Sacred Tree,
From the old tribe on Usk.

The rook croaked homeward heavily,
The west was clear and warm,
The smoke of evening food and ease
Rose like a blue tree in the trees
When he came to Eldred's farm.

But Eldred's farm was fallen awry,
Like an old cripple's bones,
And Eldred's tools were red with rust,
And on his well was a green crust,
And purple thistles upward thrust,
Between the kitchen stones.

But smoke of some good feasting
Went upwards evermore,
And Eldred's doors stood wide apart
For loitering foot or labouring cart,
And Eldred's great and foolish heart
Stood open like his door.

A mighty man was Eldred,
A bulk for casks to fill,
His face a dreaming furnace,
His body a walking hill.

In the old wars of Wessex
His sword had sunken deep,
But all his friends, he signed and said,
Were broken about Ethelred;
And between the deep drink and the dead
He had fallen upon sleep.

""Come not to me, King Alfred, Save always for the ale:
Why should my harmless hinds be slain
Because the chiefs cry once again,
As in all fights, that we shall gain,
And in all fights we fail?

""Your scalds still thunder and prophesy
That crown that never comes;
Friend, I will watch the certain things,
Swine, and slow moons like silver rings,
And the ripening of the plums.""

And Alfred answered, drinking,
And gravely, without blame,
""Nor bear I boast of scald or king,
The thing I bear is a lesser thing,
But comes in a better name.

""Out of the mouth of the Mother of God,
More than the doors of doom,
I call the muster of Wessex men
From grassy hamlet or ditch or den,
To break and be broken, God knows when,
But I have seen for whom.

Out of the mouth of the Mother of God
Like a little word come I;
For I go gathering Christian men
From sunken paving and ford and fen,
To die in a battle, God knows when,
By God, but I know why.

""And this is the word of Mary,
The word of the world's desire
`No more of comfort shall ye get,
Save that the sky grows darker yet
And the sea rises higher.' ""

Then silence sank. And slowly
Arose the sea-land lord,
Like some vast beast for mystery,
He filled the room and porch and sky,
And from a cobwebbed nail on high
Unhooked his heavy sword.

Up on the shrill sea-downs and up
Went Alfred all alone,
Turning but once e'er the door was shut,
Shouting to Eldred over his butt,
That he bring all spears to the woodman's hut
Hewn under Egbert's Stone.

And he turned his back and broke the fern,
And fought the moths of dusk,
And went on his way for other friends
Friends fallen of all the wide world's ends,
From Rome that wrath and pardon sends
And the grey tribes on Usk.

He saw gigantic tracks of death
And many a shape of doom,
Good steadings to grey ashes gone
And a monk's house white like a skeleton
In the green crypt of the combe.

And in many a Roman villa
Earth and her ivies eat,
Saw coloured pavements sink and fade
In flowers, and the windy colonnade
Like the spectre of a street.

But the cold stars clustered
Among the cold pines
Ere he was half on his pilgrimage
Over the western lines.

And the white dawn widened
Ere he came to the last pine,
Where Mark, the man from Italy,
Still made the Christian sign.

The long farm lay on the large hill-side,
Flat like a painted plan,
And by the side the low white house,
Where dwelt the southland man.

A bronzed man, with a bird's bright eye,
And a strong bird's beak and brow,
His skin was brown like buried gold,
And of certain of his sires was told
That they came in the shining ship of old,
With Caesar in the prow.

His fruit trees stood like soldiers
Drilled in a straight line,
His strange, stiff olives did not fail,
And all the kings of the earth drank ale,
But he drank wine.

Wide over wasted British plains
Stood never an arch or dome,
Only the trees to toss and reel,
The tribes to bicker, the beasts to squeal;
But the eyes in his head were strong like steel,
And his soul remembered Rome.

Then Alfred of the lonely spear
Lifted his lion head;
And fronted with the Italian's eye,
Asking him of his whence and why,
King Alfred stood and said:

""I am that oft-defeated King
Whose failure fills the land,
Who fled before the Danes of old,
Who chaffered with the Danes with gold,
Who now upon the Wessex wold
Hardly has feet to stand.

""But out of the mouth of the Mother of God
I have seen the truth like fire,
This--that the sky grows darker yet
And the sea rises higher.""

Long looked the Roman on the land;
The trees as golden crowns
Blazed, drenched with dawn and dew-empearled
While faintlier coloured, freshlier curled,
The clouds from underneath the world
Stood up over the downs.

""These vines be ropes that drag me hard,""
He said. ""I go not far;
Where would you meet? For you must hold
Half Wiltshire and the White Horse wold,
And the Thames bank to Owsenfold,
If Wessex goes to war.

""Guthrum sits strong on either bank
And you must press his lines
Inwards, and eastward drive him down;
I doubt if you shall take the crown
Till you have taken London town.
For me, I have the vines.""

""If each man on the Judgment Day
Meet God on a plain alone,""
Said Alfred, ""I will speak for you
As for myself, and call it true
That you brought all fighting folk you knew
Lined under Egbert's Stone.

""Though I be in the dust ere then,
I know where you will be.""
And shouldering suddenly his spear
He faded like some elfin fear,
Where the tall pines ran up, tier on tier
Tree overtoppling tree.

He shouldered his spear at morning
And laughed to lay it on,
But he leaned on his spear as on a staff,
With might and little mood to laugh,
Or ever he sighted chick or calf
Of Colan of Caerleon.

For the man dwelt in a lost land
Of boulders and broken men,
In a great grey cave far off to the south
Where a thick green forest stopped the mouth,
Giving darkness in his den.

And the man was come like a shadow,
From the shadow of Druid trees,
Where Usk, with mighty murmurings,
Past Caerleon of the fallen kings,
Goes out to ghostly seas.

Last of a race in ruin--
He spoke the speech of the Gaels;
His kin were in holy Ireland,
Or up in the crags of Wales.

But his soul stood with his mother's folk,
That were of the rain-wrapped isle,
Where Patrick and Brandan westerly
Looked out at last on a landless sea
And the sun's last smile.

His harp was carved and cunning,
As the Celtic craftsman makes,
Graven all over with twisting shapes
Like many headless snakes.

His harp was carved and cunning,
His sword prompt and sharp,
And he was gay when he held the sword,
Sad when he held the harp.

For the great Gaels of Ireland
Are the men that God made mad,
For all their wars are merry,
And all their songs are sad.

He kept the Roman order,
He made the Christian sign;
But his eyes grew often blind and bright,
And the sea that rose in the rocks at night
Rose to his head like wine.

He made the sign of the cross of God,
He knew the Roman prayer,
But he had unreason in his heart
Because of the gods that were.

Even they that walked on the high cliffs,
High as the clouds were then,
Gods of unbearable beauty,
That broke the hearts of men.

And whether in seat or saddle,
Whether with frown or smile,
Whether at feast or fight was he,
He heard the noise of a nameless sea
On an undiscovered isle.

Lifting the great green ivy
And the great spear lowering,
One said, ""I am Alfred of Wessex,
And I am a conquered king.""

And the man of the cave made answer,
And his eyes were stars of scorn,
""And better kings were conquered
Or ever your sires were born.

""What goddess was your mother,
What fay your breed begot,
That you should not die with Uther
And Arthur and Lancelot?

""But when you win you brag and blow,
And when you lose you rail,
Army of eastland yokels
Not strong enough to fail.""

""I bring not boast or railing,""
Spake Alfred not in ire,
""I bring of Our Lady a lesson set,
This--that the sky grows darker yet
And the sea rises higher.""

Then Colan of the Sacred Tree
Tossed his black mane on high,
And cried, as rigidly he rose,
""And if the sea and sky be foes,
We will tame the sea and sky.""

Smiled Alfred, ""Seek ye a fable
More dizzy and more dread
Than all your mad barbarian tales
Where the sky stands on its head ?

""A tale where a man looks down on the sky
That has long looked down on him;
A tale where a man can swallow a sea
That might swallow the seraphim.

""Bring to the hut by Egbert's Stone
All bills and bows ye have.""
And Alfred strode off rapidly,
And Colan of the Sacred Tree
Went slowly to his cave.




BOOK III THE HARP OF ALFRED


In a tree that yawned and twisted
The King's few goods were flung,
A mass-book mildewed, line by line,
And weapons and a skin of wine,
And an old harp unstrung.

By the yawning tree in the twilight
The King unbound his sword,
Severed the harp of all his goods,
And there in the cool and soundless woods
Sounded a single chord.

Then laughed; and watched the finches flash,
The sullen flies in swarm,
And went unarmed over the hills,
With the harp upon his arm,


Until he came to the White Horse Vale
And saw across the plains,
In the twilight high and far and fell,
Like the fiery terraces of hell,
The camp fires of the Danes--

The fires of the Great Army
That was made of iron men,
Whose lights of sacrilege and scorn
Ran around England red as morn,
Fires over Glastonbury Thorn--
Fires out on Ely Fen.

And as he went by White Horse Vale
He saw lie wan and wide
The old horse graven, God knows when,
By gods or beasts or what things then
Walked a new world instead of men
And scrawled on the hill-side.

And when he came to White Horse Down
The great White Horse was grey,
For it was ill scoured of the weed,
And lichen and thorn could crawl and feed,
Since the foes of settled house and creed
Had swept old works away.

King Alfred gazed all sorrowful
At thistle and mosses grey,
Then laughed; and watched the finches flash,
Till a rally of Danes with shield and bill
Rolled drunk over the dome of the hill,
And, hearing of his harp and skill,
They dragged him to their play.

And as they went through the high green grass
They roared like the great green sea;
But when they came to the red camp fire
They were silent suddenly.

And as they went up the wastes away
They went reeling to and fro;
But when they came to the red camp fire
They stood all in a row.

For golden in the firelight,
With a smile carved on his lips,
And a beard curled right cunningly,
Was Guthrum of the Northern Sea,
The emperor of the ships--

With three great earls King Guthrum
Went the rounds from fire to fire,
With Harold, nephew of the King,
And Ogier of the Stone and Sling,
And Elf, whose gold lute had a string
That sighed like all desire.

The Earls of the Great Army
That no men born could tire,
Whose flames anear him or aloof
Took hold of towers or walls of proof,
Fire over Glastonbury roof
And out on Ely, fire.

And Guthrum heard the soldiers' tale
And bade the stranger play;
Not harshly, but as one on high,
On a marble pillar in the sky,
Who sees all folk that live and die--
Pigmy and far away.

And Alfred, King of Wessex,
Looked on his conqueror--
And his hands hardened; but he played,
And leaving all later hates unsaid,
He sang of some old British raid
On the wild west march of yore.

He sang of war in the warm wet shires,
Where rain nor fruitage fails,
Where England of the motley states
Deepens like a garden to the gates
In the purple walls of Wales.

He sang of the seas of savage heads
And the seas and seas of spears,
Boiling all over Offa's Dyke,
What time a Wessex club could strike
The kings of the mountaineers.

Till Harold laughed and snatched the harp,
The kinsman of the King,
A big youth, beardless like a child,
Whom the new wine of war sent wild,
Smote, and began to sing--

And he cried of the ships as eagles
That circle fiercely and fly,
And sweep the seas and strike the towns
From Cyprus round to Skye.

How swiftly and with peril
They gather all good things,
The high horns of the forest beasts,
Or the secret stones of kings.

""For Rome was given to rule the world,
And gat of it little joy--
But we, but we shall enjoy the world,
The whole huge world a toy.

""Great wine like blood from Burgundy,
Cloaks like the clouds from Tyre,
And marble like solid moonlight,
And gold like frozen fire.

""Smells that a man might swill in a cup,
Stones that a man might eat,
And the great smooth women like ivory
That the Turks sell in the street.""

He sang the song of the thief of the world,
And the gods that love the thief;
And he yelled aloud at the cloister-yards,
Where men go gathering grief.

""Well have you sung, O stranger,
Of death on the dyke in Wales,
Your chief was a bracelet-giver;
But the red unbroken river
Of a race runs not for ever,
But suddenly it fails.

""Doubtless your sires were sword-swingers
When they waded fresh from foam,
Before they were turned to women
By the god of the nails from Rome;

""But since you bent to the shaven men,
Who neither lust nor smite,
Thunder of Thor, we hunt you
A hare on the mountain height.""

King Guthrum smiled a little,
And said, ""It is enough,
Nephew, let Elf retune the string;
A boy must needs like bellowing,
But the old ears of a careful king
Are glad of songs less rough.""

Blue-eyed was Elf the minstrel,
With womanish hair and ring,
Yet heavy was his hand on sword,
Though light upon the string.

And as he stirred the strings of the harp
To notes but four or five,
The heart of each man moved in him
Like a babe buried alive.

And they felt the land of the folk-songs
Spread southward of the Dane,
And they heard the good Rhine flowing
In the heart of all Allemagne.

They felt the land of the folk-songs,
Where the gifts hang on the tree,
Where the girls give ale at morning
And the tears come easily.

The mighty people, womanlike,
That have pleasure in their pain
As he sang of Balder beautiful,
Whom the heavens loved in vain.

As he sang of Balder beautiful,
Whom the heavens could not save,
Till the world was like a sea of tears
And every soul a wave. 

""There is always a thing forgotten
When all the world goes well;
A thing forgotten, as long ago,
When the gods forgot the mistletoe,
And soundless as an arrow of snow
The arrow of anguish fell.

""The thing on the blind side of the heart,
On the wrong side of the door,
The green plant groweth, menacing
Almighty lovers in the spring;
There is always a forgotten thing,
And love is not secure.""

And all that sat by the fire were sad,
Save Ogier, who was stern,
And his eyes hardened, even to stones,
As he took the harp in turn;

Earl Ogier of the Stone and Sling
Was odd to ear and sight,
Old he was, but his locks were red,
And jests were all the words he said
Yet he was sad at board and bed
And savage in the fight.

""You sing of the young gods easily
In the days when you are young;
But I go smelling yew and sods,
And I know there are gods behind the gods,
Gods that are best unsung.

""And a man grows ugly for women,
And a man grows dull with ale,
Well if he find in his soul at last
Fury, that does not fail.

""The wrath of the gods behind the gods
Who would rend all gods and men,
Well if the old man's heart hath still
Wheels sped of rage and roaring will,
Like cataracts to break down and kill,
Well for the old man then--

""While there is one tall shrine to shake,
Or one live man to rend;
For the wrath of the gods behind the gods
Who are weary to make an end.

""There lives one moment for a man
When the door at his shoulder shakes,
When the taut rope parts under the pull,
And the barest branch is beautiful
One moment, while it breaks.

""So rides my soul upon the sea
That drinks the howling ships,
Though in black jest it bows and nods
Under the moons with silver rods,
I know it is roaring at the gods,
Waiting the last eclipse.

""And in the last eclipse the sea
Shall stand up like a tower,
Above all moons made dark and riven,
Hold up its foaming head in heaven,
And laugh, knowing its hour.

""And the high ones in the happy town
Propped of the planets seven,
Shall know a new light in the mind,
A noise about them and behind,
Shall hear an awful voice, and find
Foam in the courts of heaven.

""And you that sit by the fire are young,
And true love waits for you;
But the king and I grow old, grow old,
And hate alone is true.""

And Guthrum shook his head but smiled,
For he was a mighty clerk,
And had read lines in the Latin books
When all the north was dark.

He said, ""I am older than you, Ogier;
Not all things would I rend,
For whether life be bad or good
It is best to abide the end.""

He took the great harp wearily,
Even Guthrum of the Danes,
With wide eyes bright as the one long day
On the long polar plains.

For he sang of a wheel returning,
And the mire trod back to mire,
And how red hells and golden heavens
Are castles in the fire.

""It is good to sit where the good tales go,
To sit as our fathers sat;
But the hour shall come after his youth,
When a man shall know not tales but truth,
And his heart fail thereat.

""When he shall read what is written
So plain in clouds and clods,
When he shall hunger without hope
Even for evil gods.

""For this is a heavy matter,
And the truth is cold to tell;
Do we not know, have we not heard,
The soul is like a lost bird,
The body a broken shell.

""And a man hopes, being ignorant,
Till in white woods apart
He finds at last the lost bird dead:
And a man may still lift up his head
But never more his heart.

""There comes no noise but weeping
Out of the ancient sky,
And a tear is in the tiniest flower
Because the gods must die.

""The little brooks are very sweet,
Like a girl's ribbons curled,
But the great sea is bitter
That washes all the world.

""Strong are the Roman roses,
Or the free flowers of the heath,
But every flower, like a flower of the sea,
Smelleth with the salt of death.

""And the heart of the locked battle
Is the happiest place for men;
When shrieking souls as shafts go by
And many have died and all may die;
Though this word be a mystery,
Death is most distant then.

""Death blazes bright above the cup,
And clear above the crown;
But in that dream of battle
We seem to tread it down.

""Wherefore I am a great king,
And waste the world in vain,
Because man hath not other power,
Save that in dealing death for dower,
He may forget it for an hour
To remember it again.""

And slowly his hands and thoughtfully
Fell from the lifted lyre,
And the owls moaned from the mighty trees
Till Alfred caught it to his knees
And smote it as in ire.

He heaved the head of the harp on high
And swept the framework barred,
And his stroke had all the rattle and spark
Of horses flying hard.

""When God put man in a garden
He girt him with a sword,
And sent him forth a free knight
That might betray his lord;

""He brake Him and betrayed Him,
And fast and far he fell,
Till you and I may stretch our necks
And burn our beards in hell.

""But though I lie on the floor of the world,
With the seven sins for rods,
I would rather fall with Adam
Than rise with all your gods.

""What have the strong gods given?
Where have the glad gods led?
When Guthrum sits on a hero's throne
And asks if he is dead?

""Sirs, I am but a nameless man,
A rhymester without home,
Yet since I come of the Wessex clay
And carry the cross of Rome,

""I will even answer the mighty earl
That asked of Wessex men
Why they be meek and monkish folk,
And bow to the White Lord's broken yoke;
What sign have we save blood and smoke?
Here is my answer then.

""That on you is fallen the shadow,
And not upon the Name;
That though we scatter and though we fly,
And you hang over us like the sky,
You are more tired of victory,
Than we are tired of shame.

""That though you hunt the Christian man
Like a hare on the hill-side,
The hare has still more heart to run
Than you have heart to ride.

""That though all lances split on you,
All swords be heaved in vain,
We have more lust again to lose
Than you to win again.

""Your lord sits high in the saddle,
A broken-hearted king,
But our king Alfred, lost from fame,
Fallen among foes or bo",

BOOK IV THE WOMAN IN THE FOREST,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
Thick thunder of the snorting swine,,,,
Enormous in the gloam,,,,
Rending among all roots that cling,,,,
And the wild horses whinnying,,,,
Were the night's noises when the King,,,,
Shouldering his harp, went home.,,,
,,,,
With eyes of owl and feet of fox,,,,
Full of all thoughts he went;,,,,
He marked the tilt of the pagan camp,,,,
The paling of pine, the sentries' tramp,,,
And the one great stolen altar-lamp,,,,
Over Guthrum in his tent.,,,,
,,,,
By scrub and thorn in Ethandune ,,,,
That night the foe had lain;,,,,
Whence ran across the heather grey,,,,
The old stones of a Roman way; ,,,,
And in a wood not far away,,,,
The pale road split in twain.,,,,
,,,,
He marked the wood and the cloven ways,,,,
With an old captain's eyes,,,,
And he thought how many a time had he,,,,
Sought to see Doom he could not see;,,,,
How ruin had come and victory,,,,
And both were a surprise.,,,,
,,,,
Even so he had watched and wondered,,,,
Under Ashdown from the plains;,,,,
With Ethelred praying in his tent,,,,
Till the white hawthorn swung and bent,,,,
As Alfred rushed his spears and rent,,,,
The shield-wall of the Danes.,,,,
,,,,
Even so he had watched and wondered,,,,
Knowing neither less nor more,,,,
Till all his lords lay dying,,,,
And axes on axes plying,,,,
Flung him, and drove him flying,,,
Like a pirate to the shore.,,,,
,,,,
Wise he had been before defeat,,,,
And wise before success;,,,,
Wise in both hours and ignorant,,,,
Knowing neither more nor less.,,,,
,,,,
As he went down to the river-hut,,,,
He knew a night-shade scent,,,,
Owls did as evil cherubs rise,,,,
With little wings and lantern eyes,,,,
As though he sank through the under-skies;,,,,
But down and down he went.,,,,
,,,,
As he went down to the river-hut,,,,
He went as one that fell;,,,,
Seeing the high forest domes and spars.,,,,
Dim green or torn with golden scars,,,,
As the proud look up at the evil stars,,,,
In the red heavens of hell.,,,,
,,,,
For he must meet by the river-hut,,,,
Them he had bidden to arm,,,,
Mark from the towers of Italy,,,,
And Colan of the Sacred Tree,,,,
And Eldred who beside the sea,,,,
Held heavily his farm.,,,,
,,,,
The roof leaned gaping to the grass,,,,
As a monstrous mushroom lies;,,,,
Echoing and empty seemed the place;,,,,
But opened in a little space,,,,
A great grey woman with scarred face,,,,
And strong and humbled eyes.,,,,
,,,,
King Alfred was but a meagre man,,,,
Bright eyed, but lean and pale:,,,
And swordless, with his harp and rags,,,
He seemed a beggar, such as lags,,,
Looking for crusts and ale.,,,,
,,,,
And the woman, with a woman's eyes,,,
Of pity at once and ire,,,,
Said, when that she had glared a span,,,
There is a cake for any man,,,,
"If he will watch the fire.""""",,,,
,,,,
And Alfred, bowing heavily,,,
Sat down the fire to stir,,,,
And even as the woman pitied him,,,,
So did he pity her.,,,,
,,,,
Saying," """"O great heart in the night",,,
O best cast forth for worst,,,,
Twilight shall melt and morning stir,,,,
And no kind thing shall come to her,,,,
Till God shall turn the world over,,,,
And all the last are first.,,,,
,,,,
And well may God with the serving-folk,,,,
Cast in His dreadful lot;,,,,
Is not He too a servant,,,,
And is not He forgot ?,,,,
,,,,
For was not God my gardener,,,,
And silent like a slave;,,,,
That opened oaks on the uplands,,,,
Or thicket in graveyard gave?,,,,
,,,,
And was not God my armourer,,,,
All patient and unpaid,,,,
That sealed my skull as a helmet,,,,
And ribs for hauberk made?,,,,
,,,,
Did not a great grey servant,,,,
Of all my sires and me,,,,
Build this pavilion of the pines,,,,
And herd the fowls and fill the vines,,,,
And labour and pass and leave no signs,,,,
Save mercy and mystery?,,,,
,,,,
For God is a great servant,,,,
And rose before the day,,,,
From some primordial slumber torn;,,,,
But all we living later born,,,,
Sleep on, and rise after the morn,,,
And the Lord has gone away.,,,,
,,,,
On things half sprung from sleeping,,,,
All sleepy suns have shone,,,,
They stretch stiff arms, the yawning trees,,,
The beasts blink upon hands and knees,,,,
Man is awake and does and sees--,,,,
But Heaven has done and gone.,,,,
,,,,
For who shall guess the good riddle,,,,
Or speak of the Holiest,,,,
Save in faint figures and failing words,,,,
Who loves, yet laughs among the swords,,,
Labours, and is at rest?,,,
,,,,
But some see God like Guthrum,,,,
Crowned, with a great beard curled,,,
But I see God like a good giant,,,,
That, labouring, lifts the world.,,
,,,,
Wherefore was God in Golgotha,,,,
Slain as a serf is slain;,,,,
And hate He had of prince and peer,,,,
And love He had and made good cheer,,,,
Of them that, like this woman here,,,
Go powerfully in pain.,,,,
,,,,
But in this grey morn of man's life,,,,
Cometh sometime to the mind,,,,
A little light that leaps and flies,,,,
Like a star blown on the wind.,,,,
,,,,
A star of nowhere, a nameless star,,,
A light that spins and swirls,,,,
And cries that even in hedge and hill,,,,
Even on earth, it may go ill,,,
At last with the evil earls.,,,,
,,,,
A dancing sparkle, a doubtful star,,,
On the waste wind whirled and driven;,,,,
But it seems to sing of a wilder worth,,,,
A time discrowned of doom and birth,,,,
And the kingdom of the poor on earth,,,,
Come, as it is in heaven.,,,
,,,,
But even though such days endure,,,,
How shall it profit her?,,,,
Who shall go groaning to the grave,,,,
With many a meek and mighty slave,,,,
Field-breaker and fisher on the wave,,,,
And woodman and waggoner.,,,,
,,,,
Bake ye the big world all again,,,,
A cake with kinder leaven;,,,,
Yet these are sorry evermore--,,,,
Unless there be a little door,,,,
"A little door in heaven.""""",,,,
,,,,
And as he wept for the woman,,,,
He let her business be,,,,
And like his royal oath and rash,,,,
The good food fell upon the ash,,,,
And blackened instantly.,,,,
,,,,
Screaming, the woman caught a cake,,,
Yet burning from the bar,,,,
And struck him suddenly on the face,,,,
Leaving a scarlet scar.,,,,
,,,,
King Alfred stood up wordless,,,,
A man dead with surprise,,,,
And torture stood and the evil things,,,,
That are in the childish hearts of kings,,,,
An instant in his eyes.,,,,
,,,,
And even as he stood and stared,,,,
Drew round him in the dusk,,,,
Those friends creeping from far-off farms,,,,
Marcus with all his slaves in arms,,,,
And the strange spears hung with ancient charms,,,,
Of Colan of the Usk.,,,,
,,,,
With one whole farm marching afoot,,,,
The trampled road resounds,,,,
Farm-hands and farm-beasts blundering by,,,,
And jars of mead and stores of rye,,,,
Where Eldred strode above his high,,,,
And thunder-throated hounds.,,,,
,,,,
And grey cattle and silver lowed,,,,
Against the unlifted morn,,,,
And straw clung to the spear-shafts tall.,,,,
And a boy went before them all,,,,
Blowing a ram's horn.,,,,
,,,,
As mocking such rude revelry,,,,
The dim clan of the Gael,,,,
Came like a bad king's burial-end,,,,
With dismal robes that drop and rend,,,,
And demon pipes that wail--,,,,
,,,,
In long, outlandish garments,,,
Torn, though of antique worth,,,
With Druid beards and Druid spears,,,,
As a resurrected race appears,,,,
Out of an elder earth.,,,,
,,,,
And though the King had called them forth,,,,
And knew them for his own,,,,
So still each eye stood like a gem,,,,
So spectral hung each broidered hem,,,,
Grey carven men he fancied them,,,,
Hewn in an age of stone.,,,,
,,,,
And the two wild peoples of the north,,,,
Stood fronting in the gloam,,,,
And heard and knew each in its mind,,,,
The third great thunder on the wind,,,,
The living walls that hedge mankind,,,,
The walking walls of Rome.,,,,
,,,,
Mark's were the mixed tribes of the west,,,,
Of many a hue and strain,,,,
Gurth, with rank hair like yellow grass,,,
And the Cornish fisher, Gorlias,,,
And Halmer, come from his first mass,,,
Lately baptized, a Dane.,,,
,,,,
But like one man in armour,,,,
Those hundreds trod the field,,,,
From red Arabia to the Tyne,,,,
The earth had heard that marching-line,,,,
Since the cry on the hill Capitoline,,,,
And the fall of the golden shield.,,,,
,,,,
And the earth shook and the King stood still,,,,
Under the greenwood bough,,,,
And the smoking cake lay at his feet,,,,
And the blow was on his brow.,,,,
,,,,
Then Alfred laughed out suddenly,,,,
Like thunder in the spring,,,,
Till shook aloud the lintel-beams,,,,
And the squirrels stirred in dusty dreams,,,,
And the startled birds went up in streams,,,,
For the laughter of the King.,,,,
,,,,
And the beasts of the earth and the birds looked down,,,,
In a wild solemnity,,,,
On a stranger sight than a sylph or elf,,,,
On one man laughing at himself,,,,
Under the greenwood tree--,,,,
,,,,
The giant laughter of Christian men,,,,
That roars through a thousand tales,,,,
Where greed is an ape and pride is an ass,,,,
And Jack's away with his master's lass,,,,
And the miser is banged with all his brass,,,,
The farmer with all his flails;,,,,
,,,,
Tales that tumble and tales that trick,,,,
Yet end not all in scorning--,,,,
Of kings and clowns in a merry plight,,,,
And the clock gone wrong and the world gone right,,,,
That the mummers sing upon Christmas night,,,,
And Christmas Day in the morning.,,,,
,,,,
Now here is a good warrant,,,,
Cried Alfred," """"by my sword;",,,
For he that is struck for an ill servant,,,,
Should be a kind lord.,,,,
,,,,
He that has been a servant,,,,
Knows more than priests and kings,,,,
But he that has been an ill servant,,,,
He knows all earthly things.,,,,
,,,,
Pride flings frail palaces at the sky,,,,
As a man flings up sand,,,,
But the firm feet of humility,,,,
Take hold of heavy land.,,,,
,,,,
Pride juggles with her toppling towers,,,,
They strike the sun and cease,,,,
But the firm feet of humility,,,,
They grip the ground like trees.,,,,
,,,,
He that hath failed in a little thing,,,,
Hath a sign upon the brow;,,,,
And the Earls of the Great Army,,,,
Have no such seal to show.,,,,
,,,,
The red print on my forehead,,,,
Small flame for a red star,,,,
In the van of the violent marching, then,,,
When the sky is torn of the trumpets ten,,,,
And the hands of the happy howling men,,,,
Fling wide the gates of war.,,,,
,,,,
This blow that I return not,,,,
Ten times will I return,,,,
On kings and earls of all degree,,,,
And armies wide as empires be,,,,
Shall slide like landslips to the sea,,,,
If the red star burn.,,,,
,,,,
One man shall drive a hundred,,,,
As the dead kings drave;,,,,
Before me rocking hosts be riven,,,,
And battering cohorts backwards driven,,,,
For I am the first king known of Heaven,,,,
That has been struck like a slave.,,,,
,,,,
Up on the old white road, brothers,,,
Up on the Roman walls!,,,,
For this is the night of the drawing of swords,,,,
And the tainted tower of the heathen hordes,,,,
Leans to our hammers, fires and cords,,,
Leans a little and falls.,,,,
,,,,
Follow the star that lives and leaps,,,,
Follow the sword that sings,,,,
For we go gathering heathen men,,,,
A terrible harvest, ten by ten,,,
As the wrath of the last red autumn--then,,,,
When Christ reaps down the kings.,,,,
,,,,
Follow a light that leaps and spins,,,,
Follow the fire unfurled!,,,,
For riseth up against realm and rod,,,,
A thing forgotten, a thing downtrod,,,
The last lost giant, even God,,,
"Is risen against the world.""""",,,,
,,,,
Roaring they went o'er the Roman wall,,,,
And roaring up the lane,,,,
Their torches tossed a ladder of fire,,,,
Higher their hymn was heard and higher,,,,
More sweet for hate and for heart's desire,,,,
And up in the northern scrub and brier,,,,
They fell upon the Dane.,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
BOOK V ETHANDUNE: THE FIRST STROKE,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
King Guthrum was a dread king,,,,
Like death out of the north;,,,,
Shrines without name or number,,,,
He rent and rolled as lumber,,,,
From Chester to the Humber,,,,
He drove his foemen forth.,,,,
,,,,
The Roman villas heard him,,,,
In the valley of the Thames,,,,
Come over the hills roaring,,,,
Above their roofs, and pouring,,,
On spire and stair and flooring,,,,
Brimstone and pitch and flames.,,,,
,,,,
Sheer o'er the great chalk uplands,,,,
And the hill of the Horse went he,,,,
Till high on Hampshire beacons,,,,
He saw the southern sea.,,,,
,,,,
High on the heights of Wessex,,,,
He saw the southern brine,,,,
And turned him to a conquered land,,,,
And where the northern thornwoods stand,,,,
And the road parts on either hand,,,,
There came to him a sign.,,,,
,,,,
King Guthrum was a war-chief,,,,
A wise man in the field,,,,
And though he prospered well, and knew,,,
How Alfred's folk were sad and few,,,,
Not less with weighty care he drew,,,,
Long lines for pike and shield.,,,,
,,,,
King Guthrum lay on the upper land,,,,
On a single road at gaze,,,,
And his foe must come with lean array,,,,
Up the left arm of the cloven way,,,,
To the meeting of the ways.,,,,
,,,,
And long ere the noise of armour,,,,
An hour ere the break of light,,,,
The woods awoke with crash and cry,,,,
And the birds sprang clamouring harsh and high,,,,
And the rabbits ran like an elves' army,,,,
Ere Alfred came in sight.,,,,
,,,,
The live wood came at Guthrum,,,,
On foot and claw and wing,,,,
The nests were noisy overhead,,,,
For Alfred and the star of red,,,,
All life went forth, and the forest fled,,,
Before the face of the King.,,,,
,,,,
But halted in the woodways,,,,
Christ's few were grim and grey,,,,
And each with a small, far, bird-like sight,,
Saw the high folly of the fight;,,,,
And though strange joys had grown in the night,,,,
Despair grew with the day.,,,,
,,,,
And when white dawn crawled through the wood,,,,
Like cold foam of a flood,,,,
Then weakened every warrior's mood,,,,
In hope, though not in hardihood;,,,
And each man sorrowed as he stood,,,,
In the fashion of his blood.,,,,
,,,,
For the Saxon Franklin sorrowed,,,,
For the things that had been fair;,,,,
For the dear dead woman, crimson-clad,,,
And the great feasts and the friends he had;,,,,
But the Celtic prince's soul was sad,,,,
For the things that never were.,,,,
,,,,
In the eyes Italian all things,,,,
But a black laughter died;,,,,
And Alfred flung his shield to earth,,,,
And smote his breast and cried--,,,,
,,,,
I wronged a man to his slaying,,,,
And a woman to her shame,,,,
And once I looked on a sworn maid,,,,
That was wed to the Holy Name.,,,,
,,,,
And once I took my neighbour's wife,,,,
That was bound to an eastland man,,,,
In the starkness of my evil youth,,,,
Before my griefs began.,,,,
,,,,
People, if you have any prayers,,,
Say prayers for me:,,,,
And lay me under a Christian stone,,,,
In that lost land I thought my own,,,,
To wait till the holy horn is blown,,,,
"And all poor men are free.""""",,,,
,,,,
Then Eldred of the idle farm,,,,
Leaned on his ancient sword,,,,
As fell his heavy words and few;,,,,
And his eyes were of such alien blue,,,,
As gleams where the Northman saileth new,,,,
Into an unknown fiord.,,,,
,,,,
I was a fool and wasted ale--,,,,
My slaves found it sweet;,,,,
I was a fool and wasted bread,,,,
And the birds had bread to eat.,,,,
,,,,
The kings go up and the kings go down,,,,
And who knows who shall rule;,,,,
Next night a king may starve or sleep,,,,
But men and birds and beasts shall weep,,,,
At the burial of a fool.,,,,
,,,,
O, drunkards in my cellar,,,
Boys in my apple tree,,,,
The world grows stern and strange and new,,,,
And wise men shall govern you,,,,
And you shall weep for me.,,,,
,,,,
But yoke me my own oxen,,,,
Down to my own farm;,,,,
My own dog will whine for me,,,,
My own friends will bend the knee,,,,
And the foes I slew openly,,,,
"Have never wished me harm.""""",,,,
,,,,
And all were moved a little,,,,
But Colan stood apart,,,,
Having first pity, and after,,,
Hearing, like rat in rafter,,,
That little worm of laughter,,,,
That eats the Irish heart.,,,,
,,,,
And his grey-green eyes were cruel,,,,
And the smile of his mouth waxed hard,,,,
And he said," """"And when did Britain",,,
Become your burying-yard?,,,,
,,,,
Before the Romans lit the land,,,,
When schools and monks were none,,,,
We reared such stones to the sun-god,,,,
As might put out the sun.,,,,
,,,,
The tall trees of Britain,,,,
We worshipped and were wise,,,,
But you shall raid the whole land through,,,,
And never a tree shall talk to you,,,,
Though every leaf is a tongue taught true,,,,
And the forest is full of eyes.,,,,
,,,,
On one round hill to the seaward,,,,
The trees grow tall and grey,,,,
And the trees talk together,,,,
When all men are away.,,,,
,,,,
O'er a few round hills forgotten,,,,
The trees grow tall in rings,,,,
And the trees talk together,,,,
Of many pagan things.,,,,
,,,,
Yet I could lie and listen,,,,
With a cross upon my clay,,,,
And hear unhurt for ever,,,,
"What the trees of Britain say.""""",,,,
,,,,
A proud man was the Roman,,,,
His speech a single one,,,,
But his eyes were like an eagle's eyes,,,,
That is staring at the sun.,,,,
,,,,
Dig for me where I die, he said,,,
If first or last I fall--,,,,
Dead on the fell at the first charge,,,,
Or dead by Wantage wall;,,,,
,,,,
Lift not my head from bloody ground,,,,
Bear not my body home,,,,
For all the earth is Roman earth,,,,
"And I shall die in Rome.""""",,,,
,,,,
Then Alfred, King of England,,,
Bade blow the horns of war,,,,
And fling the Golden Dragon out,,,,
With crackle and acclaim and shout,,,,
Scrolled and aflame and far.,,,,
,,,,
And under the Golden Dragon,,,,
Went Wessex all along,,,,
Past the sharp point of the cloven ways,,,,
Out from the black wood into the blaze,,,,
Of sun and steel and song.,,,,
,,,,
And when they came to the open land,,,,
They wheeled, deployed and stood;,,,
Midmost were Marcus and the King,,,,
And Eldred on the right-hand wing,,,,
And leftwards Colan darkling,,,,
In the last shade of the wood.,,,,
,,,,
But the Earls of the Great Army,,,,
Lay like a long half moon,,,,
Ten poles before their palisades,,,,
With wide-winged helms and runic blades,,,,
Red giants of an age of raids,,,,
In the thornland of Ethandune.,,,,
,,,,
Midmost the saddles rose and swayed,,,,
And a stir of horses' manes,,,,
Where Guthrum and a few rode high,,,,
On horses seized in victory;,,,,
But Ogier went on foot to die,,,,
In the old way of the Danes.,,,,
,,,,
Far to the King's left Elf the bard,,,,
Led on the eastern wing,,,,
With songs and spells that change the blood;,,,,
And on the King's right Harold stood,,,,
The kinsman of the King.,,,,
,,,,
Young Harold, coarse, with colours gay,,
Smoking with oil and musk,,,,
And the pleasant violence of the young,,,,
Pushed through his people, giving tongue,,,
Foewards, where, grey as cobwebs hung,,
The banners of the Usk.,,,,
,,,,
But as he came before his line,,,,
A little space along,,,,
His beardless face broke into mirth,,,,
"And he cried: """"What broken bits of earth",,,,
Are here? For what their clothes are worth,,,,
"I would sell them for a song.""""",,,,
,,,,
For Colan was hung with raiment,,,,
Tattered like autumn leaves,,,,
And his men were all as thin as saints,,,,
And all as poor as thieves.,,,,
,,,,
No bows nor slings nor bolts they bore,,,,
But bills and pikes ill-made;,,,,
And none but Colan bore a sword,,,,
And rusty was its blade.,,,,
,,,,
And Colan's eyes with mystery,,,,
And iron laughter stirred,,,,
And he spoke aloud, but lightly,,,
Not labouring to be heard.,,,,
,,,,
Oh, truly we be broken hearts,,,
For that cause, it is said,,,
We light our candles to that Lord,,,,
That broke Himself for bread.,,,,
,,,,
But though we hold but bitterly,,,,
What land the Saxon leaves,,,,
Though Ireland be but a land of saints,,,,
And Wales a land of thieves,,,,
,,,,
I say you yet shall weary,,,,
Of the working of your word,,,,
That stricken spirits never strike,,,,
Nor lean hands hold a sword.,,,,
,,,,
And if ever ye ride in Ireland,,,,
The jest may yet be said,,,,
There is the land of broken hearts,,,,
"And the land of broken heads.""""",,,,
,,,,
Not less barbarian laughter,,,,
Choked Harold like a flood,,,,
And shall I fight with scarecrows,,,,
That am of Guthrum's blood?,,,,
,,,,
Meeting may be of war-men,,,,
Where the best war-man wins;,,,,
But all this carrion a man shoots,,,,
"Before the fight begins.""""",,,,
,,,,
And stopping in his onward strides,,,,
He snatched a bow in scorn,,,,
From some mean slave, and bent it on,,,
Colan, whose doom grew dark; and shone,,,
Stars evil over Caerleon,,,,
In the place where he was born.,,,,
,,,,
For Colan had not bow nor sling,,,,
On a lonely sword leaned he,,,,
Like Arthur on Excalibur,,,,
In the battle by the sea.,,,,
,,,,
To his great gold ear-ring Harold,,,,
Tugged back the feathered tail,,,,
And swift had sprung the arrow,,,,
But swifter sprang the Gael.,,,,
,,,,
Whirling the one sword round his head,,,,
A great wheel in the sun,,,,
He sent it splendid through the sky,,,,
Flying before the shaft could fly--,,,,
It smote Earl Harold over the eye,,,,
And blood began to run.,,,,
,,,,
Colan stood bare and weaponless,,,,
Earl Harold, as in pain,,,
Strove for a smile, put hand to head,,,
Stumbled and suddenly fell dead;,,,,
And the small white daisies all waxed red,,,,
With blood out of his brain.,,,,
,,,,
And all at that marvel of the sword,,,,
Cast like a stone to slay,,,,
"Cried out. Said Alfred: """"Who would see",,,,
Signs, must give all things. Verily,,,
Man shall not taste of victory,,,,
"Till he throws his sword away.""""",,,,
,,,,
Then Alfred, prince of England,,,
And all the Christian earls,,,,
Unhooked their swords and held them up,,,,
Each offered to Colan, like a cup,,,
Of chrysolite and pearls.,,,,
,,,,
And the King said," """"Do thou take my sword",,,
Who have done this deed of fire,,,,
For this is the manner of Christian men,,,,
Whether of steel or priestly pen,,,,
That they cast their hearts out of their ken,,,,
To get their heart's desire.,,,,
,,,,
And whether ye swear a hive of monks,,,,
Or one fair wife to friend,,,,
This is the manner of Christian men,,,,
That their oath endures the end.,,,,
,,,,
For love, our Lord, at the end of the world,,
Sits a red horse like a throne,,,,
With a brazen helm and an iron bow,,,,
But one arrow alone.,,,,
,,,,
Love with the shield of the Broken Heart,,,,
Ever his bow doth bend,,,,
With a single shaft for a single prize,,,,
And the ultimate bolt that parts and flies,,,,
Comes with a thunder of split skies,,,,
And a sound of souls that rend.,,,,
,,,,
So shall you earn a king's sword,,,,
"Who cast your sword away.""""",,,,
And the King took, with a random eye,,,
A rude axe from a hind hard by,,,,
And turned him to the fray.,,,,
,,,,
For the swords of the Earls of Daneland,,,,
Flamed round the fallen lord.,,,,
The first blood woke the trumpet-tune,,,,
As in monk's rhyme or wizard's rune,,,,
Beginneth the battle of Ethandune,,,,
With the throwing of the sword.,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
BOOK VI ETHANDUNE: THE SLAYING OF THE CHIEFS,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
As the sea flooding the flat sands,,,,
Flew on the sea-born horde,,,,
The two hosts shocked with dust and din,,,,
Left of the Latian paladin,,,,
Clanged all Prince Harold's howling kin,,,,
On Colan and the sword.,,,,
,,,,
Crashed in the midst on Marcus,,,,
Ogier with Guthrum by,,,,
And eastward of such central stir,,,,
Far to the right and faintlier,,,,
The house of Elf the harp-player,,,,
Struck Eldred's with a cry.,,,,
,,,,
The centre swat for weariness,,,,
Stemming the screaming horde,,,,
And wearily went Colan's hands,,,,
That swung King Alfred's sword.,,,,
,,,,
But like a cloud of morning,,,,
To eastward easily,,,,
Tall Eldred broke the sea of spears,,,,
As a tall ship breaks the sea.,,,,
,,,,
His face like a sanguine sunset,,,,
His shoulder a Wessex down,,,,
His hand like a windy hammer-stroke;,,,,
Men could not count the crests he broke,,,,
So fast the crests went down.,,,,
,,,,
As the tall white devil of the Plague,,,,
Moves out of Asian skies,,,,
With his foot on a waste of cities,,,,
And his head in a cloud of flies;,,,,
,,,,
Or purple and peacock skies grow dark,,,,
With a moving locust-tower;,,,,
Or tawny sand-winds tall and dry,,,,
Like hell's red banners beat and fly,,,,
When death comes out of Araby,,,,
Was Eldred in his hour.,,,,
,,,,
But while he moved like a massacre,,,,
He murmured as in sleep,,,,
And his words were all of low hedges,,,,
And little fields and sheep.,,,,
,,,,
Even as he strode like a pestilence,,,,
That strides from Rhine to Rome,,,,
He thought how tall his beans might be,,,,
If ever he went home.,,,,
,,,,
Spoke some stiff piece of childish prayer,,,,
Dull as the distant chimes,,,,
That thanked our God for good eating,,,,
And corn and quiet times--,,,,
,,,,
Till on the helm of a high chief,,,,
Fell shatteringly his brand,,,,
And the helm broke and the bone broke,,,,
And the sword broke in his hand.,,,,
,,,,
Then from the yelling Northmen,,,,
Driven splintering on him ran,,,,
Full seven spears, and the seventh,,,
Was never made by man.,,,,
,,,,
Seven spears, and the seventh,,,
Was wrought as the faerie blades,,,,
And given to Elf the minstrel,,,,
By the monstrous water-maids;,,,,
,,,,
By them that dwell where luridly,,,,
Lost waters of the Rhine,,,,
Move among roots of nations,,,,
Being sunken for a sign.,,,,
,,,,
Under all graves they murmur,,,,
They murmur and rebel,,,,
Down to the buried kingdoms creep,,,,
And like a lost rain roar and weep,,,,
O'er the red heavens of hell.,,,,
,,,,
Thrice drowned was Elf the minstrel,,,,
And washed as dead on sand;,,,,
And the third time men found him,,,,
The spear was in his hand.,,,,
,,,,
Seven spears went about Eldred,,,,
Like stays about a mast;,,,,
But there was sorrow by the sea,,,,
For the driving of the last.,,,,
,,,,
Six spears thrust upon Eldred,,,,
Were splintered while he laughed;,,,,
One spear thrust into Eldred,,,,
Three feet of blade and shaft.,,,,
,,,,
And from the great heart grievously,,,,
Came forth the shaft and blade,,,,
And he stood with the face of a dead man,,,,
Stood a little, and swayed--,,,
,,,,
Then fell, as falls a battle-tower,,,
On smashed and struggling spears.,,,,
Cast down from some unconquered town,,,,
That, rushing earthward, carries down,,
Loads of live men of all renown--,,,,
Archers and engineers.,,,,
,,,,
And a great clamour of Christian men,,,,
Went up in agony,,,,
Crying," """"Fallen is the tower of Wessex",,,
"That stood beside the sea.""""",,,,
,,,,
Centre and right the Wessex guard,,,,
Grew pale for doubt and fear,,,,
And the flank failed at the advance,,,,
For the death-light on the wizard lance--,,,,
The star of the evil spear.,,,,
,,,,
Stand like an oak, cried Marcus,,,
Stand like a Roman wall!,,,,
Eldred the Good is fallen--,,,,
Are you too good to fall?,,,,
,,,,
When we were wan and bloodless,,,,
He gave you ale enow;,,,,
The pirates deal with him as dung,,,,
"God! are you bloodless now?""""",,,,
,,,,
Grip, Wulf and Gorlias, grip the ash!,,
Slaves, and I make you free!,,,
Stamp, Hildred hard in English land,,,
Stand Gurth, stand Gorlias, Gawen stand!,,
Hold, Halfgar, with the other hand,,
Halmer, hold up on knee!,,,
,,,,
The lamps are dying in your homes,,,,
The fruits upon your bough;,,,,
Even now your old thatch smoulders, Gurth,,,
Now is the judgment of the earth,,,,
Now is the death-grip," now!""""",,,
,,,,
For thunder of the captain,,,,
Not less the Wessex line,,,,
Leaned back and reeled a space to rear,,,,
As Elf charged with the Rhine maids' spear,,,,
And roaring like the Rhine.,,,,
,,,,
For the men were borne by the waving walls,,,,
Of woods and clouds that pass,,,,
By dizzy plains and drifting sea,,,,
And they mixed God with glamoury,,,,
God with the gods of the burning tree,,,,
And the wizard's tower and glass.,,,,
,,,,
But Mark was come of the glittering towns,,,,
Where hot white details show,,,,
Where men can number and expound,,,,
And his faith grew in a hard ground,,,,
Of doubt and reason and falsehood found,,,,
Where no faith else could grow.,,,,
,,,,
Belief that grew of all beliefs,,,,
One moment back was blown,,,,
And belief that stood on unbelief,,,,
Stood up iron and alone.,,,,
,,,,
The Wessex crescent backwards,,,,
Crushed, as with bloody spear,,,
Went Elf roaring and routing,,,,
And Mark against Elf yet shouting,,,,
Shocked, in his mid-career.,,,
,,,,
Right on the Roman shield and sword,,,,
Did spear of the Rhine maids run;,,,,
But the shield shifted never,,,,
The sword rang down to sever,,,,
The great Rhine sang for ever,,,,
And the songs of Elf were done.,,,,
,,,,
And a great thunder of Christian men,,,,
Went up against the sky,,,,
Saying," """"God hath broken the evil spear",,,
"Ere the good man's blood was dry.""""",,,,
,,,,
"Spears at the charge!"""" yelled Mark amain.",,,,
Death on the gods of death!,,,,
Over the thrones of doom and blood,,,,
Goeth God that is a craftsman good,,,,
And gold and iron, earth and wood,,,
Loveth and laboureth.,,,,
,,,,
The fruits leap up in all your farms,,,,
The lamps in each abode;,,,,
God of all good things done on earth,,,,
All wheels or webs of any worth,,,,
The God that makes the roof, Gurth,,,
The God that makes the road.,,,,
,,,,
The God that heweth kings in oak,,,,
Writeth songs on vellum,,,,
God of gold and flaming glass,,,,
Confregit potentias,,,,
Acrcuum, scutum, Gorlias,,
"Gladium et bellum.""""",,,,
,,,,
Steel and lightning broke about him,,,,
Battle-bays and palm,,,,
All the sea-kings swayed among,,,,
Woods of the Wessex arms upflung,,,,
The trumpet of the Roman tongue,,,,
The thunder of the psalm.,,,,
,,,,
And midmost of that rolling field,,,,
Ran Ogier ragingly,,,,
Lashing at Mark, who turned his blow,,,
And brake the helm about his brow,,,,
And broke him to his knee.,,,,
,,,,
Then Ogier heaved over his head,,,,
His huge round shield of proof;,,,,
But Mark set one foot on the shield,,,,
One on some sundered rock upheeled,,,,
And towered above the tossing field,,,,
A statue on a roof.,,,,
,,,,
Dealing far blows about the fight,,,,
Like thunder-bolts a-roam,,,,
Like birds about the battle-field,,,,
While Ogier writhed under his shield,,,,
Like a tortoise in his dome.,,,,
,,,,
But hate in the buried Ogier,,,,
Was strong as pain in hell,,,,
With bare brute hand from the inside,,,,
He burst the shield of brass and hide,,,,
And a death-stroke to the Roman's side,,,,
Sent suddenly and well.,,,,
,,,,
Then the great statue on the shield,,,,
Looked his last look around,,,,
With level and imperial eye;,,,,
And Mark, the man from Italy,,,
Fell in the sea of agony,,,,
And died without a sound.,,,,
,,,,
And Ogier, leaping up alive,,,
Hurled his huge shield away,,,,
Flying, as when a juggler flings,,,
A whizzing plate in play.,,,,
,,,,
And held two arms up rigidly,,,,
And roared to all the Danes:,,,,
Fallen is Rome, yea, fallen,,
The city of the plains!,,,,
,,,,
Shall no man born remember,,,,
That breaketh wood or weald,,,,
How long she stood on the roof of the world,,,,
As he stood on my shield.,,,,
,,,,
The new wild world forgetteth her,,,,
As foam fades on the sea,,,,
How long she stood with her foot on Man,,,,
As he with his foot on me.,,,,
,,,,
No more shall the brown men of the south,,,,
Move like the ants in lines,,,,
To quiet men with olives,,,,
Or madden men with vines.,,,,
,,,,
No more shall the white towns of the south,,,,
Where Tiber and Nilus run,,,,
Sitting around a secret sea,,,,
Worship a secret sun.,,,,
,,,,
The blind gods roar for Rome fallen,,,,
And forum and garland gone,,,,
For the ice of the north is broken,,,,
And the sea of the north comes on.,,,,
,,,,
The blind gods roar and rave and dream,,,,
Of all cities under the sea,,,,
For the heart of the north is broken,,,,
And the blood of the north is free.,,,,
,,,,
Down from the dome of the world we come,,,,
Rivers on rivers down,,,,
Under us swirl the sects and hordes,,,,
And the high dooms we drown.,,,,
,,,,
Down from the dome of the world and down,,,,
Struck flying as a skiff,,,,
On a river in spate is spun and swirled,,,,
Until we come to the end of the world,,,,
That breaks short, like a cliff.,,,
,,,,
And when we come to the end of the world,,,,
For me, I count it fit,,,
To take the leap like a good river,,,,
Shot shrieking over it.,,,,
,,,,
But whatso hap at the end of the world,,,,
Where Nothing is struck and sounds,,,,
It is not, by Thor, these monkish men,,
These humbled Wessex hounds--,,,,
,,,,
Not this pale line of Christian hinds,,,,
This one white string of men,,,,
Shall keep us back from the end of the world,,,,
And the things that happen then.,,,,
,,,,
It is not Alfred's dwarfish sword,,,,
Nor Egbert's pigmy crown,,,,
Shall stay us now that descend in thunder,,,,
Rending the realms and the realms thereunder,,,,
"Down through the world and down.""""",,,,
,,,,
There was that in the wild men back of him,,,,
There was that in his own wild song,,,,
A dizzy throbbing, a drunkard smoke,,,
That dazed to death all Wessex folk,,,,
And swept their spears along.,,,,
,,,,
Vainly the sword of Colan,,,,
And the axe of Alfred plied--,,,,
The Danes poured in like a brainless plague,,,,
And knew not when they died.,,,,
,,,,
Prince Colan slew a score of them,,,,
And was stricken to his knee;,,,,
King Alfred slew a score and seven,,,,
And was borne back on a tree.,,,,
,,,,
Back to the black gate of the woods,,,,
Back up the single way,,,,
Back by the place of the parting ways,,,,
Christ's knights were whirled away.,,,,
,,,,
And when they came to the parting ways,,,,
Doom's heaviest hammer fell,,,,
For the King was beaten, blind, at bay,,
Down the right lane with his array,,,,
But Colan swept the other way,,,,
Where he smote great strokes and fell.,,,,
,,,,
The thorn-woods over Ethandune,,,,
Stand sharp and thick as spears,,,,
By night and furze and forest-harms,,,,
Far sundered were the friends in arms;,,,,
The loud lost blows, the last alarms,,,
Came not to Alfred's ears.,,,,
,,,,
The thorn-woods over Ethandune,,,,
Stand stiff as spikes in mail;,,,,
As to the Haut King came at morn,,,,
Dead Roland on a doubtful horn,,,,
Seemed unto Alfred lightly borne,,,,
The last cry of the Gael.,,,,
,,,,
,,,,

BOOK VIII ETHANDUNE: THE LAST CHARGE,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
Away in the waste of White Horse Down,,,,
An idle child alone,,,,
Played some small game through hours that pass,,,,
And patiently would pluck the grass,,,,
Patiently push the stone.,,,,
,,,,
On the lean, green edge for ever,,,
Where the blank chalk touched the turf,,,,
The child played on, alone, divine,,
As a child plays on the last line,,,,
That sunders sand and surf.,,,,
,,,,
For he dwelleth in high divisions,,,,
Too simple to understand,,,,
Seeing on what morn of mystery,,,,
The Uncreated rent the sea,,,,
With roarings, from the land.,,,
,,,,
Through the long infant hours like days,,,,
He built one tower in vain--,,,,
Piled up small stones to make a town,,,,
And evermore the stones fell down,,,,
And he piled them up again.,,,,
,,,,
And crimson kings on battle-towers,,,,
And saints on Gothic spires,,,,
And hermits on their peaks of snow,,,,
And heroes on their pyres,,,,
,,,,
And patriots riding royally,,,,
That rush the rocking town,,,,
Stretch hands, and hunger and aspire,,,
Seeking to mount where high and higher,,,,
The child whom Time can never tire,,,,
Sings over White Horse Down.,,,,
,,,,
And this was the might of Alfred,,,,
At the ending of the way;,,,,
That of such smiters, wise or wild,,,
He was least distant from the child,,,,
Piling the stones all day.,,,,
,,,,
For Eldred fought like a frank hunter,,,,
That killeth and goeth home;,,,,
And Mark had fought because all arms,,,,
Rang like the name of Rome.,,,,
,,,,
And Colan fought with a double mind,,,,
Moody and madly gay;,,,,
But Alfred fought as gravely,,,,
As a good child at play.,,,,
,,,,
He saw wheels break and work run back,,,,
And all things as they were;,,,,
And his heart was orbed like victory,,,,
And simple like despair.,,,,
,,,,
Therefore is Mark forgotten,,,,
That was wise with his tongue and brave;,,,,
And the cairn over Colan crumbled,,,,
And the cross on Eldred's grave.,,,,
,,,,
Their great souls went on a wind away,,,,
And they have not tale or tomb;,,,,
And Alfred born in Wantage,,,,
Rules England till the doom.,,,,
,,,,
Because in the forest of all fears,,,,
Like a strange fresh gust from sea,,,,
Struck him that ancient innocence,,,,
That is more than mastery.,,,,
,,,,
And as a child whose bricks fall down,,,,
Re-piles them o'er and o'er,,,,
Came ruin and the rain that burns,,,,
Returning as a wheel returns,,,,
And crouching in the furze and ferns,,,,
He began his life once more.,,,,
,,,,
He took his ivory horn unslung,,,,
And smiled, but not in scorn:,,,
Endeth the Battle of Ethandune,,,,
"With the blowing of a horn.""""",,,,
,,,,
On a dark horse at the double way,,,,
He saw great Guthrum ride,,,,
Heard roar of brass and ring of steel,,,,
The laughter and the trumpet peal,,,,
The pagan in his pride.,,,,
,,,,
And Ogier's red and hated head,,,,
Moved in some talk or task;,,,,
But the men seemed scattered in the brier,,,,
And some of them had lit a fire,,,,
And one had broached a cask.,,,,
,,,,
And waggons one or two stood up,,,,
Like tall ships in sight,,,,
As if an outpost were encamped,,,,
At the cloven ways for night.,,,,
,,,,
And joyous of the sudden stay,,,,
Of Alfred's routed few,,,,
Sat one upon a stone to sigh,,,,
And some slipped up the road to fly,,,,
Till Alfred in the fern hard by,,,,
Set horn to mouth and blew.,,,,
,,,,
And they all abode like statues--,,,,
One sitting on the stone,,,,
One half-way through the thorn hedge tall,,,,
One with a leg across a wall,,,,
And one looked backwards, very small,,,
Far up the road, alone.,,,
,,,,
Grey twilight and a yellow star,,,,
Hung over thorn and hill;,,,,
Two spears and a cloven war-shield lay,,,,
Loose on the road as cast away,,,,
The horn died faint in the forest grey,,,,
And the fleeing men stood still.,,,,
,,,,
Brothers at arms, said Alfred,,,
On this side lies the foe;,,,,
Are slavery and starvation flowers,,,,
That you should pluck them so?,,,,
,,,,
For whether is it better,,,,
To be prodded with Danish poles,,,,
Having hewn a chamber in a ditch,,,,
And hounded like a howling witch,,,,
Or smoked to death in holes?,,,,
,,,,
Or that before the red cock crow,,,,
All we, a thousand strong,,,
Go down the dark road to God's house,,,,
Singing a Wessex song?,,,,
,,,,
To sweat a slave to a race of slaves,,,,
To drink up infamy?,,,,
No, brothers, by your leave, I think,
Death is a better ale to drink,,,,
And by all the stars of Christ that sink,,,,
The Danes shall drink with me.,,,,
,,,,
To grow old cowed in a conquered land,,,,
With the sun itself discrowned,,,,
To see trees crouch and cattle slink--,,,,
Death is a better ale to drink,,,,
And by high Death on the fell brink,,,,
That flagon shall go round.,,,,
,,,,
Though dead are all the paladins,,,,
Whom glory had in ken,,,,
Though all your thunder-sworded thanes,,,,
With proud hearts died among the Danes,,,,
While a man remains, great war remains:,,,
Now is a war of men.,,,,
,,,,
The men that tear the furrows,,,,
The men that fell the trees,,,,
When all their lords be lost and dead,,,,
The bondsmen of the earth shall tread,,,,
The tyrants of the seas.,,,,
,,,,
The wheel of the roaring stillness,,,,
Of all labours under the sun,,,,
Speed the wild work as well at least,,,,
As the whole world's work is done.,,,,
,,,,
Let Hildred hack the shield-wall,,,,
Clean as he hacks the hedge;,,,,
Let Gurth the fowler stand as cool,,,,
As he stands on the chasm's edge;,,,,
,,,,
Let Gorlias ride the sea-kings,,,,
As Gorlias rides the sea,,,,
Then let all hell and Denmark drive,,,,
Yelling to all its fiends alive,,,,
"And not a rag care we.""""",,,,
,,,,
When Alfred's word was ended,,,,
Stood firm that feeble line,,,,
Each in his place with club or spear,,,,
And fury deeper than deep fear,,,,
And smiles as sour as brine.,,,,
,,,,
And the King held up the horn and said,,,,
See ye my father's horn,,,,
That Egbert blew in his empery,,,,
Once, when he rode out commonly,,,
Twice when he rode for venery,,,,
And thrice on the battle-morn.,,,,
,,,,
But heavier fates have fallen,,,,
The horn of the Wessex kings,,,,
And I blew once, the riding sign,,,
To call you to the fighting line,,,,
And glory and all good things.,,,,
,,,,
And now two blasts, the hunting sign,,,
Because we turn to bay;,,,,
But I will not blow the three blasts,,,,
Till we be lost or they.,,,,
,,,,
And now I blow the hunting sign,,,,
Charge some by rule and rod;,,,,
But when I blow the battle sign,,,,
"Charge all and go to God.""""",,,,
,,,,
Wild stared the Danes at the double ways,,,,
Where they loitered, all at large,,,
As that dark line for the last time,,,,
Doubled the knee to charge--,,,,
,,,,
And caught their weapons clumsily,,,,
And marvelled how and why--,,,,
In such degree, by rule and rod,,,
The people of the peace of God,,,,
Went roaring down to die.,,,,
,,,,
And when the last arrow,,,,
Was fitted and was flown,,,,
When the broken shield hung on the breast,,,,
And the hopeless lance was laid in rest,,,,
And the hopeless horn blown,,,,
,,,,
The King looked up, and what he saw,,,
Was a great light like death,,,,
For Our Lady stood on the standards rent,,,,
As lonely and as innocent,,,,
As when between white walls she went,,,,
And the lilies of Nazareth.,,,,
,,,,
One instant in a still light,,,,
He saw Our Lady then,,,,
Her dress was soft as western sky,,,,
And she was a queen most womanly--,,,,
But she was a queen of men.,,,,
,,,,
Over the iron forest,,,,
He saw Our Lady stand,,,,
Her eyes were sad withouten art,,,,
And seven swords were in her heart--,,,,
But one was in her hand.,,,,
,,,,
Then the last charge went blindly,,,,
And all too lost for fear:,,,,
The Danes closed round, a roaring ring,,,
And twenty clubs rose o'er the King,,,,
Four Danes hewed at him, halloing,,,
And Ogier of the Stone and Sling,,,,
Drove at him with a spear.,,,,
,,,,
But the Danes were wild with laughter,,,,
And the great spear swung wide,,,,
The point stuck to a straggling tree,,,,
And either host cried suddenly,,,,
As Alfred leapt aside.,,,,
,,,,
Short time had shaggy Ogier,,,,
To pull his lance in line--,,,,
He knew King Alfred's axe on high,,,,
He heard it rushing through the sky,,,,
,,,,
He cowered beneath it with a cry--,,,,
It split him to the spine:,,,,
And Alfred sprang over him dead,,,,
And blew the battle sign.,,,,
,,,,
Then bursting all and blasting,,,,
Came Christendom like death,,,,
Kicked of such catapults of will,,,,
The staves shiver, the barrels spill,,,
The waggons waver and crash and kill,,,,
The waggoners beneath.,,,,
,,,,
Barriers go backwards, banners rend,,,
Great shields groan like a gong--,,,,
Horses like horns of nightmare,,,,
Neigh horribly and long.,,,,
,,,,
Horses ramp high and rock and boil,,,,
And break their golden reins,,,,
And slide on carnage clamorously,,,,
Down where the bitter blood doth lie,,,,
Where Ogier went on foot to die,,,,
In the old way of the Danes.,,,,
,,,,
"The high tide!"""" King Alfred cried.",,,,
The high tide and the turn!,,,,
As a tide turns on the tall grey seas,,,,
See how they waver in the trees,,,,
How stray their spears, how knock their knees,,,
How wild their watchfires burn!,,,,
,,,,
The Mother of God goes over them,,,,
Walking on wind and flame,,,,
And the storm-cloud drifts from city and dale,,,,
And the White Horse stamps in the White Horse Vale,,,,
And we all shall yet drink Christian ale,,,,
In the village of our name.,,,,
,,,,
The Mother of God goes over them,,,,
On dreadful cherubs borne;,,,,
And the psalm is roaring above the rune,,,,
And the Cross goes over the sun and moon,,,,
Endeth the battle of Ethandune,,,,
"With the blowing of a horn.""""",,,,
,,,,
For back indeed disorderly,,,,
The Danes went clamouring,,,,
Too worn to take anew the tale,,,,
Or dazed with insolence and ale,,,,
Or stunned of heaven, or stricken pale,,,
Before the face of the King.,,,,
,,,,
For dire was Alfred in his hour,,,,
The pale scribe witnesseth,,,,
More mighty in defeat was he,,,,
Than all men else in victory,,,,
And behind, his men came murderously,,,
Dry-throated, drinking death.,,,
,,,,
And Edgar of the Golden Ship,,,,
He slew with his own hand,,,,
Took Ludwig from his lady's bower,,,,
And smote down Harmar in his hour,,,,
And vain and lonely stood the tower--,,,,
The tower in Guelderland.,,,,
,,,,
And Torr out of his tiny boat,,,,
Whose eyes beheld the Nile,,,,
Wulf with his war-cry on his lips,,,,
And Harco born in the eclipse,,,,
Who blocked the Seine with battleships,,,,
Round Paris on the Isle.,,,,
,,,,
And Hacon of the Harvest-Song,,,,
And Dirck from the Elbe he slew,,,,
And Cnut that melted Durham bell,,,,
And Fulk and fiery Oscar fell,,,,
And Goderic and Sigael,,,,
And Uriel of the Yew.,,,,
,,,,
And highest sang the slaughter,,,,
And fastest fell the slain,,,,
When from the wood-road's blackening throat,,,,
A crowning and crashing wonder smote,,,,
The rear-guard of the Dane.,,,,
,,,,
For the dregs of Colan's company--,,,,
Lost down the other road--,,,,
Had gathered and grown and heard the din,,,,
And with wild yells came pouring in,,,,
Naked as their old British kin,,,,
And bright with blood for woad.,,,,
,,,,
And bare and bloody and aloft,,,,
They bore before their band,,,,
The body of the mighty lord,,,,
Colan of Caerleon and its horde,,,,
That bore King Alfred's battle-sword,,,,
Broken in his left hand.,,,,
,,,,
And a strange music went with him,,,,
Loud and yet strangely far;,,,,
The wild pipes of the western land,,,,
Too keen for the ear to understand,,,,
Sang high and deathly on each hand,,,,
When the dead man went to war.,,,,
,,,,
Blocked between ghost and buccaneer,,,,
Brave men have dropped and died;,,,,
And the wild sea-lords well might quail,,,,
As the ghastly war-pipes of the Gael,,,,
Called to the horns of White Horse Vale,,,,
And all the horns replied.,,,,
,,,,
And Hildred the poor hedger,,,,
Cut down four captains dead,,,,
And Halmar laid three others low,,,,
And the great earls wavered to and fro,,,,
For the living and the dead.,,,,
,,,,
And Gorlias grasped the great flag,,,,
The Raven of Odin, torn;,,,
And the eyes of Guthrum altered,,,,
For the first time since morn.,,,,
,,,,
As a turn of the wheel of tempest,,,,
Tilts up the whole sky tall,,,,
And cliffs of wan cloud luminous,,,,
Lean out like great walls over us,,,,
As if the heavens might fall.,,,,
,,,,
As such a tall and tilted sky,,,,
Sends certain snow or light,,,,
So did the eyes of Guthrum change,,,,
And the turn was more certain and more strange,,,,
Than a thousand men in flight.,,,,
,,,,
For not till the floor of the skies is split,,,,
And hell-fire shines through the sea,,,,
Or the stars look up through the rent earth's knees,,,,
Cometh such rending of certainties,,,,
As when one wise man truly sees,,,,
What is more wise than he.,,,,
,,,,
He set his horse in the battle-breech,,,,
Even Guthrum of the Dane,,,,
And as ever had fallen fell his brand,,,,
A falling tower o'er many a land,,,,
But Gurth the fowler laid one hand,,,,
Upon this bridle rein.,,,,
,,,,
King Guthrum was a great lord,,,,
And higher than his gods--,,,,
He put the popes to laughter,,,,
He chid the saints with rods,,,,
,,,,
He took this hollow world of ours,,,,
For a cup to hold his wine;,,,,
In the parting of the woodways,,,,
There came to him a sign.,,,,
,,,,
In Wessex in the forest,,,,
In the breaking of the spears,,,,
We set a sign on Guthrum,,,,
To blaze a thousand years.,,,,
,,,,
Where the high saddles jostle,,,,
And the horse-tails toss,,,,
There rose to the birds flying,,,,
A roar of dead and dying;,,,,
In deafness and strong crying,,,,
We signed him with the cross.,,,,
,,,,
Far out to the winding river,,,,
The blood ran down for days,,,,
When we put the cross on Guthrum,,,,
In the parting of the ways.,,,,
,,,,

BOOK VIII THE SCOURING OF THE HORSE,,,,
,,,,
,,,,
In the years of the peace of Wessex,,,,
When the good King sat at home;,,,,
Years following on that bloody boon,,,,
When she that stands above the moon,,,,
Stood above death at Ethandune,,,,
And saw his kingdom come--,,,,
,,,,
When the pagan people of the sea,,,,
Fled to their palisades,,,,
Nailed there with javelins to cling,,,,
And wonder smote the pirate king,,,,
And brought him to his christening,,,,
And the end of all his raids.,,,,
,,,,
(For not till the night's blue slate is wiped,,,,
Of its last star utterly,,,,
And fierce new signs writ there to read,,,,
Shall eyes with such amazement heed,,,,
As when a great man knows indeed,,,,
A greater thing than he.),,,,
,,,,
And there came to his chrism-loosing,,,,
Lords of all lands afar,,,,
And a line was drawn north-westerly,,,,
That set King Egbert's empire free,,,,
Giving all lands by the northern sea,,,,
To the sons of the northern star.,,,,
,,,,
In the days of the rest of Alfred,,,,
When all these things were done,,,,
And Wessex lay in a patch of peace,,,,
Like a dog in a patch of sun--,,,,
,,,,
The King sat in his orchard,,,,
Among apples green and red,,,,
With the little book in his bosom,,,,
And the sunshine on his head.,,,,
,,,,
And he gathered the songs of simple men,,,,
That swing with helm and hod,,,,
And the alms he gave as a Christian,,,,
Like a river alive with fishes ran;,,,,
And he made gifts to a beggar man,,,,
As to a wandering god.,,,,
,,,,
And he gat good laws of the ancient kings,,,,
Like treasure out of the tombs;,,,,
And many a thief in thorny nook,,,,
Or noble in sea-stained turret shook,,,,
For the opening of his iron book,,,,
And the gathering of the dooms.,,,,
,,,,
Then men would come from the ends of the earth,,,,
Whom the King sat welcoming,,,,
And men would go to the ends of the earth,,,,
Because of the word of the King.,,,,
,,,,
For folk came in to Alfred's face,,,,
Whose javelins had been hurled,,,,
On monsters that make boil the sea,,,,
Crakens and coils of mystery.,,,,
Or thrust in ancient snows that be,,,,
The white hair of the world.,,,,
,,,,
And some had knocked at the northern gates,,,,
Of the ultimate icy floor,,,,
Where the fish freeze and the foam turns black,,,,
And the wide world narrows to a track,,,,
And the other sea at the world's back,,,,
Cries through a closed door.,,,,
,,,,
And men went forth from Alfred's face,,,,
Even great gift-bearing lords,,,,
Not to Rome only, but more bold,,,
Out to the high hot courts of old,,,,
Of negroes clad in cloth of gold,,,,
Silence, and crooked swords,,,
,,,,
Scrawled screens and secret gardens,,,,
And insect-laden skies--,,,,
Where fiery plains stretch on and on,,,,
To the purple country of Prester John,,,,
And the walls of Paradise.,,,,
,,,,
And he knew the might of the Terre Majeure,,,,
Where kings began to reign;,,,,
Where in a night-rout, without name,,,
Of gloomy Goths and Gauls there came,,,,
White, above candles all aflame,,,
Like a vision, Charlemagne.,,,
,,,,
And men, seeing such embassies,,,
Spake with the King and said:,,,,
The steel that sang so sweet a tune,,,,
On Ashdown and on Ethandune,,,,
Why hangs it scabbarded so soon,,,,
All heavily like lead?,,,,
,,,,
Why dwell the Danes in North England,,,,
And up to the river ride?,,,,
Three more such marches like thine own,,,,
Would end them; and the Pict should own,,,,
Our sway; and our feet climb the throne,,,,
"In the mountains of Strathclyde.""""",,,,
,,,,
And Alfred in the orchard,,,,
Among apples green and red,,,,
With the little book in his bosom,,,,
Looked at green leaves and said:,,,,
,,,,
When all philosophies shall fail,,,,
This word alone shall fit;,,,,
That a sage feels too small for life,,,,
And a fool too large for it.,,,,
,,,,
Asia and all imperial plains,,,,
Are too little for a fool;,,,,
But for one man whose eyes can see,,,,
The little island of Athelney,,,,
Is too large a land to rule.,,,,
,,,,
Haply it had been better,,,,
When I built my fortress there,,,,
Out in the reedy waters wide,,,,
I had stood on my mud wall and cried:,,,,
`Take England all, from tide to tide--,,,
Be Athelney my share.',,,,
,,,,
Those madmen of the throne-scramble--,,,,
Oppressors and oppressed--,,,,
Had lined the banks by Athelney,,,,
And waved and wailed unceasingly,,,,
Where the river turned to the broad sea,,,,
By an island of the blest.,,,,
,,,,
An island like a little book,,,,
Full of a hundred tales,,,,
Like the gilt page the good monks pen,,,,
That is all smaller than a wren,,,,
Yet hath high towns, meteors, and men,,
And suns and spouting whales;,,,,
,,,,
A land having a light on it,,,,
In the river dark and fast,,,,
An isle with utter clearness lit,,,,
Because a saint had stood in it;,,,,
Where flowers are flowers indeed and fit,,,,
And trees are trees at last.,,,,
,,,,
So were the island of a saint;,,,,
But I am a common king,,,,
And I will make my fences tough,,,,
From Wantage Town to Plymouth Bluff,,,,
Because I am not wise enough,,,,
"To rule so small a thing.""""",,,,
,,,,
And it fell in the days of Alfred,,,,
In the days of his repose,,,,
That as old customs in his sight,,,,
Were a straight road and a steady light,,,,
He bade them keep the White Horse white,,,,
As the first plume of the snows.,,,,
,,,,
And right to the red torchlight,,,,
From the trouble of morning grey,,,,
They stripped the White Horse of the grass,,,,
As they strip it to this day.,,,,
,,,,
And under the red torchlight,,,,
He went dreaming as though dull,,,,
Of his old companions slain like kings,,,,
And the rich irrevocable things,,,,
Of a heart that hath not openings,,,,
But is shut fast, being full.,,,
,,,,
And the torchlight touched the pale hair,,,,
Where silver clouded gold,,,,
And the frame of his face was made of cords,,,,
And a young lord turned among the lords,,,,
"And said: """"The King is old.""""",,,,
,,,,
And even as he said it,,,,
A post ran in amain,,,,
"Crying: """"Arm", Lord King, the hamlets arm,,
In the horror and the shade of harm,,,,
They have burnt Brand of Aynger's farm--,,,,
The Danes are come again!,,,,
,,,,
Danes drive the white East Angles,,,,
In six fights on the plains,,,,
Danes waste the world about the Thames,,,,
"Danes to the eastward--Danes!""""",,,,
,,,,
And as he stumbled on one knee,,,,
The thanes broke out in ire,,,,
"Crying: """"Ill the watchmen watch", and ill,,,
"The sheriffs keep the shire.""""",,,,
,,,,
"But the young earl said: """"Ill the saints",,,,
The saints of England, guard,,,
The land wherein we pledge them gold;,,,,
The dykes decay, the King grows old,,,
And surely this is hard,,,,
,,,,
That we be never quit of them;,,,,
That when his head is hoar,,,,
He cannot say to them he smote,,,,
And spared with a hand hard at the throat,,,,
`Go," and return no more.' """"",,,
,,,,
Then Alfred smiled. And the smile of him,,,,
Was like the sun for power.,,,,
But he only pointed: bade them heed,,,,
Those peasants of the Berkshire breed,,,,
Who plucked the old Horse of the weed,,,,
As they pluck it to this hour.,,,,
,,,,
Will ye part with the weeds for ever?,,,,
Or show daisies to the door?,,,,
Or will you bid the bold grass,,,,
Go, and return no more?,,,
,,,,
So ceaseless and so secret,,,,
Thrive terror and theft set free;,,,,
Treason and shame shall come to pass,,,,
While one weed flowers in a morass;,,,,
And like the stillness of stiff grass,,,,
The stillness of tyranny.,,,,
,,,,
Over our white souls also,,,,
Wild heresies and high,,,,
Wave prouder than the plumes of grass,,,,
And sadder than their sigh.,,,,
,,,,
And I go riding against the raid,,,,
And ye know not where I am;,,,,
But ye shall know in a day or year,,,,
When one green star of grass grows here;,,,,
Chaos has charged you, charger and spear,,,
Battle-axe and battering-ram.,,,,
,,,,
And though skies alter and empires melt,,,,
This word shall still be true:,,,,
If we would have the horse of old,,,,
Scour ye the horse anew.,,,,
,,,,
One time I followed a dancing star,,,,
That seemed to sing and nod,,,,
And ring upon earth all evil's knell;,,,,
But now I wot if ye scour not well,,,,
Red rust shall grow on God's great bell,,,,
"And grass in the streets of God.""""",,,,
,,,,
Ceased Alfred; and above his head,,,,
The grand green domes, the Downs,,,
Showed the first legions of the press,,,,
Marching in haste and bitterness,,,,
For Christ's sake and the crown's.,,,,
,,,,
Beyond the cavern of Colan,,,,
Past Eldred's by the sea,,,,
Rose men that owned King Alfred's rod,,,,
From the windy wastes of Exe untrod,,,,
Or where the thorn of the grave of God,,,,
Burns over Glastonbury.,,,,
,,,,
Far northward and far westward,,,,
The distant tribes drew nigh,,,,
Plains beyond plains, fell beyond fell,,,
That a man at sunset sees so well,,,,
And the tiny coloured towns that dwell,,,,
In the corners of the sky.,,,,
,,,,
But dark and thick as thronged the host,,,,
With drum and torch and blade,,,,
The still-eyed King sat pondering,,,,
As one that watches a live thing,,,,
The scoured chalk; and he said,,,,
,,,,
Though I give this land to Our Lady,,,,
That helped me in Athelney,,,,
Though lordlier trees and lustier sod,,,,
And happier hills hath no flesh trod,,,,
Than the garden of the Mother of God,,,,
Between Thames side and the sea,,,,
,,,,
I know that weeds shall grow in it,,,,
Faster than men can burn;,,,,
And though they scatter now and go,,,,
In some far century, sad and slow,,,
I have a vision, and I know,,,
The heathen shall return.,,,,
,,,,
They shall not come with warships,,,,
They shall not waste with brands,,,,
But books be all their eating,,,,
And ink be on their hands.,,,,
,,,,
Not with the humour of hunters,,,,
Or savage skill in war,,,,
But ordering all things with dead words,,,,
Strings shall they make of beasts and birds,,,,
And wheels of wind and star.,,,,
,,,,
They shall come mild as monkish clerks,,,,
With many a scroll and pen;,,,,
And backward shall ye turn and gaze,,,,
Desiring one of Alfred's days,,,,
When pagans still were men.,,,,
,,,,
The dear sun dwarfed of dreadful suns,,,,
Like fiercer flowers on stalk,,,,
Earth lost and little like a pea,,,,
In high heaven's towering forestry,,,,
#NAME?,,,,
Crawl, covering the chalk.,,,
,,,,
But though they bridge St. Mary's sea,,,,
Or steal St. Michael's wing--,,,,
Though they rear marvels over us,,,,
Greater than great Vergilius,,,,
Wrought for the Roman king;,,,,
,,,,
By this sign you shall know them,,,,
The breaking of the sword,,,,
And man no more a free knight,,,,
That loves or hates his lord.,,,,
,,,,
Yea, this shall be the sign of them,,,
The sign of the dying fire;,,,,
And Man made like a half-wit,,,,
That knows not of his sire.,,,,
,,,,
What though they come with scroll and pen,,,,
And grave as a shaven clerk,,,,
By this sign you shall know them,,,,
That they ruin and make dark;,,,,
,,,,
By all men bond to Nothing,,,,
Being slaves without a lord,,,,
By one blind idiot world obeyed,,,,
Too blind to be abhorred;,,,,
,,,,
By terror and the cruel tales,,,,
Of curse in bone and kin,,,,
By weird and weakness winning,,,,
Accursed from the beginning,,,,
By detail of the sinning,,,,
And denial of the sin;,,,,
,,,,
By thought a crawling ruin,,,,
By life a leaping mire,,,,
By a broken heart in the breast of the world,,,,
And the end of the world's desire;,,,,
,,,,
By God and man dishonoured,,,,
By death and life made vain,,,,
Know ye the old barbarian,,,,
The barbarian come again--,,,,
,,,,
When is great talk of trend and tide,,,,
And wisdom and destiny,,,,
Hail that undying heathen,,,,
That is sadder than the sea.,,,,
,,,,
In what wise men shall smite him,,,,
Or the Cross stand up again,,,,
Or charity or chivalry,,,,
My vision saith not; and I see,,,,
No more; but now ride doubtfully,,,,
"To the battle of the plain.""""",,,,
,,,,
And the grass-edge of the great down,,,,
Was cut clean as a lawn,,,,
While the levies thronged from near and far,,,,
From the warm woods of the western star,,,,
And the King went out to his last war,,,,
On a tall grey horse at dawn.,,,,
,,,,
And news of his far-off fighting,,,,
Came slowly and brokenly,,,,
From the land of the East Saxons,,,,
From the sunrise and the sea.,,,,
,,,,
From the plains of the white sunrise,,,,
And sad St. Edmund's crown,,,,
Where the pools of Essex pale and gleam,,,,
Out beyond London Town--,,,,
,,,,
In mighty and doubtful fragments,,,,
Like faint or fabled wars,,,,
Climbed the old hills of his renown,,,,
Where the bald brow of White Horse Down,,,,
Is close to the cold stars.,,,,
,,,,
But away in the eastern places,,,,
The wind of death walked high,,,,
And a raid was driven athwart the raid,,,,
The sky reddened and the smoke swayed,,,,
And the tall grey horse went by.,,,,
,,,,
The gates of the great river,,,,
Were breached as with a barge,,,,
The walls sank crowded, say the scribes,,,
And high towers populous with tribes,,,,
Seemed leaning from the charge.,,,,
,,,,
Smoke like rebellious heavens rolled,,,,
Curled over coloured flames,,,,
Mirrored in monstrous purple dreams,,,,
In the mighty pools of Thames.,,,,
,,,,
Loud was the war on London wall,,,,
And loud in London gates,,,,
And loud the sea-kings in the cloud,,,,
Broke through their dreaming gods, and loud,,,
Cried on their dreadful Fates.,,,,
,,,,
And all the while on White Horse Hill,,,,
The horse lay long and wan,,,,
The turf crawled and the fungus crept,,,,
And the little sorrel, while all men slept,,,
Unwrought the work of man.,,,,
,,,,
With velvet finger, velvet foot,,,
The fierce soft mosses then,,,,
Crept on the large white commonweal,,,,
All folk had striven to strip and peel,,,,
And the grass, like a great green witch's wheel,,,
Unwound the toils of men.,,,,
,,,,
And clover and silent thistle throve,,,,
And buds burst silently,,,,
With little care for the Thames Valley,,,,
Or what things there might be--,,,,
,,,,
That away on the widening river,,,,
In the eastern plains for crown,,,,
Stood up in the pale purple sky,,,,
One turret of smoke like ivory;,,,,
And the smoke changed and the wind went by,,,,
"And the King took London Town.""",Ballad,,,
41,John Davidson,A Ballad Of Hell,"'A letter from my love to-day!
Oh, unexpected, dear appeal!'
She struck a happy tear away,
And broke the crimson seal.

'My love, there is no help on earth,
No help in heaven; the dead-man's bell
Must toll our wedding; our first hearth
Must be the well-paved floor of hell.'

The colour died from out her face,
Her eyes like ghostly candles shone;
She cast dread looks about the place,
Then clenched her teeth and read right on.

'I may not pass the prison door;
Here must I rot from day to day,
Unless I wed whom I abhor,
My cousin, Blanche of Valencay.

'At midnight with my dagger keen,
I'll take my life; it must be so.
Meet me in hell to-night, my queen,
For weal and woe.'

She laughed although her face was wan,
She girded on her golden belt,
She took her jewelled ivory fan,
And at her glowing missal knelt.

Then rose, 'And am I mad?' she said:
She broke her fan, her belt untied;
With leather girt herself instead,
And stuck a dagger at her side.

She waited, shuddering in her room,
Till sleep had fallen on all the house.
She never flinched; she faced her doom:
They two must sin to keep their vows.

Then out into the night she went,
And, stooping, crept by hedge and tree;
Her rose-bush flung a snare of scent,
And caught a happy memory.

She fell, and lay a minute's space;
She tore the sward in her distress;
The dewy grass refreshed her face;
She rose and ran with lifted dress.

She started like a morn-caught ghost
Once when the moon came out and stood
To watch; the naked road she crossed,
And dived into the murmuring wood.

The branches snatched her streaming cloak;
A live thing shrieked; she made no stay!
She hurried to the trysting-oak‚Äî
Right well she knew the way.

Without a pause she bared her breast,
And drove her dagger home and fell,
And lay like one that takes her rest,
And died and wakened up in hell.

She bathed her spirit in the flame,
And near the centre took her post;
From all sides to her ears there came
The dreary anguish of the lost.

The devil started at her side,
Comely, and tall, and black as jet.
'I am young Malespina's bride;
Has he come hither yet?'

'My poppet, welcome to your bed.'
'Is Malespina here?'
'Not he! To-morrow he must wed
His cousin Blanche, my dear!'

'You lie, he died with me to-night.'
'Not he! it was a plot' ... 'You lie.'
'My dear, I never lie outright.'
'We died at midnight, he and I.'

The devil went. Without a groan
She, gathered up in one fierce prayer,
Took root in hell's midst all alone,
And waited for him there.

She dared to make herself at home
Amidst the wail, the uneasy stir.
The blood-stained flame that filled the dome,
Scentless and silent, shrouded her.

How long she stayed I cannot tell;
But when she felt his perfidy,
She marched across the floor of hell;
And all the damned stood up to see.

The devil stopped her at the brink:
She shook him off; she cried, 'Away!'
'My dear, you have gone mad, I think.'
'I was betrayed: I will not stay.'

Across the weltering deep she ran;
A stranger thing was never seen:
The damned stood silent to a man;
They saw the great gulf set between.

To her it seemed a meadow fair;
And flowers sprang up about her feet
She entered heaven; she climbed the stair
And knelt down at the mercy-seat.

Seraphs and saints with one great voice
Welcomed that soul that knew not fear.
Amazed to find it could rejoice,
Hell raised a hoarse, half-human cheer.",Ballad
42,Franklin Pierce Adams,A Ballad Of Baseball Burdens,"The burden of hard hitting. Slug away 
Like Honus Wagner or like Tyrus Cobb. 
Else fandom shouteth: ""Who said you could play? 
Back to the jasper league, you minor slob!""

Else you shall feel the brunt of fandom's ire

This is the end of every fan's desire. 

The burden of good pitching. Curved or straight. 
Or in or out, or haply up or down,

To lessen, so to speak, his bat-renown:

So pitch that every man can but admire 
And offer you the freedom of the town - 
This is the end of every fan's desire. 

The burden of loud cheering. O the sounds! 
The tumult and the shouting from the throats 
Of forty thousand at the Polo Grounds 
Sitting, ay, standing sans their hats and coats. 
A mighty cheer that possibly denotes 
That Cub or Pirate fat is in the fire; 
Or, as H. James would say, We've got their goats - 
This is the end of every fan's desire. 

The burden of a pennant. O the hope, 
The tenuous hope, the hope that's half a fear, 
The lengthy season and the boundless dope, 
And the bromidic, ""Wait until next year."" 
O dread disgrace of trailing in the rear, 
O Piece of Bunting, flying high and higher 
That next October it shall flutter here: 
This is the end of every fan's desire.

          The burden of fair women. Vain delight,
             And love self-slain in some sweet shameful way,
          And sorrowful old age that comes by night
             As a thief comes that has no heart by day,
             And change that finds fair cheeks and leaves them grey,
          And weariness that keeps awake for hire,
             And grief that says what pleasure used to say;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of bought kisses. This is sore,
             A burden without fruit in childbearing;
          Between the nightfall and the dawn threescore,
             Threescore between the dawn and evening.
             The shuddering in thy lips, the shuddering
          In thy sad eyelids tremulous like fire,
             Makes love seem shameful and a wretched thing.
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of sweet speeches. Nay, kneel down,
             Cover thy head, and weep; for verily
          These market-men that buy thy white and brown
             In the last days shall take no thought for thee.
             In the last days like earth thy face shall be,
          Yea, like sea-marsh made thick with brine and mire,
             Sad with sick leavings of the sterile sea.
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of long living. Thou shalt fear
             Waking, and sleeping mourn upon thy bed;
          And say at night ""Would God the day were here,""
             And say at dawn ""Would God the day were dead.""
             With weary days thou shalt be clothed and fed,
          And wear remorse of heart for thine attire,
             Pain for thy girdle and sorrow upon thine head;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of bright colours. Thou shalt see
             Gold tarnished, and the grey above the green;
          And as the thing thou seest thy face shall be,
             And no more as the thing beforetime seen.
             And thou shalt say of mercy ""It hath been,""
          And living, watch the old lips and loves expire,
             And talking, tears shall take thy breath between;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of sad sayings. In that day
             Thou shalt tell all thy days and hours, and tell
          Thy times and ways and words of love, and say
             How one was dear and one desirable,
             And sweet was life to hear and sweet to smell,
          But now with lights reverse the old hours retire
             And the last hour is shod with fire from hell;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of four seasons. Rain in spring,
             White rain and wind among the tender trees;
          A summer of green sorrows gathering,
             Rank autumn in a mist of miseries,
             With sad face set towards the year, that sees
          The charred ash drop out of the dropping pyre,
             And winter wan with many maladies;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of dead faces. Out of sight
             And out of love, beyond the reach of hands,
          Changed in the changing of the dark and light,
             They walk and weep about the barren lands
             Where no seed is nor any garner stands,
          Where in short breaths the doubtful days respire,
             And time's turned glass lets through the sighing sands;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of much gladness. Life and lust
             Forsake thee, and the face of thy delight;
          And underfoot the heavy hour strews dust,
             And overhead strange weathers burn and bite;
             And where the red was, lo the bloodless white,
          And where the truth was, the likeness of a liar,
             And where the day was, the likeness of the night;

44,Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,Ballad Of The Banished And Returning Count,"OH, enter old minstrel, thou time-honour'd one!
We children are here in the hall all alone,

The portals we straightway will bar.
Our mother is praying, our father is gone

To the forest, on wolves to make war.
Oh sing us a ballad, the tale then repeat,

'Till brother and I learn it right;
We long have been hoping a minstrel to meet,

For children hear tales with delight.

""At midnight, when darkness its fearful veil weaves,
His lofty and stately old castle he leaves,

But first he has buried his wealth.
What figure is that in his arms one perceives,

As the Count quits the gateway by stealth?
O'er what is his mantle so hastily thrown?

What bears he along in his flight?
A daughter it is, and she gently sleeps on""--

The children they hear with delight.

""The morning soon glimmers. the world is so wide,
In valleys and forests a home is supplied,

The bard in each village is cheer'd.
Thus lives he and wanders, while years onward glide,

And longer still waxes his beard;
But the maiden so fair in his arms grows amain,

'Neath her star all-protecting and bright,
Secured in the mantle from wind and from rain--""

The children they hear with delight.

""And year upon year with swift footstep now steals,
The mantle it fades, many rents it reveals,

The maiden no more it can hold.
The father he sees her, what rapture he feels!

His joy cannot now be controll'd.
How worthy she seems of the race whence she springs,

How noble and fair to the sight!
What wealth to her dearly-loved father she brings!""--

The children they hear with delight.

""Then comes there a princely knight galloping by,
She stretches her hand out, as soon as he's nigh,

But alms he refuses to give.
He seizes her hand, with a smile in his eye:

'Thou art mine!' he exclaims, 'while I live!'
'When thou know'st,' cries the old man, 'the treasure that's
there,

A princess thou'lt make her of right;
Betroth'd be she now, on this spot green and fair--'""

The children they hear with delight.

""So she's bless'd by the priest on the hallowed place,
And she goes with a smiling but sorrowful face,

From her father she fain would not part.
The old man still wanders with ne'er-changing pace,

He covers with joy his sad heart.
So I think of my daughter, as years pass away,

And my grandchildren far from my sight;
I bless them by night, and I bless them by day""--

The children they hear with delight.

He blesses the children: a knocking they hear,
The father it is! They spring forward in fear,

The old man they cannot conceal--
""Thou beggar, wouldst lure, then, my children so dear?

Straight seize him, ye vassals of steel!
To the dungeon most deep, with the fool-hardy knave!""

The mother from far hears the fight;
She hastens with flatt'ring entreaty to crave--

The children they hear with delight.

The vassals they suffer the Bard to stand there,
And mother and children implore him to spare,

The proud prince would stifle his ire,
'Till driven to fury at hearing their prayer,

""Thou pitiful race! Oh, thou beggarly crew!

Eclipsing my star, once so bright!
Ye'll bring me destruction, ye sorely shall rue!""

The old man still stands there with dignified mien,
The vassals of steel quake before him, I ween,

""My wedded existence a curse long has been,

And these are the fruits from that flower!
'Tis ever denied, and the saying is true,

That to wed with the base-born is right;
The beggar has borne me a beggarly crew,--""

""If the husband, the father, thus treats you with scorn,
If the holiest bonds by him rashly are torn,

Then come to your father--to me!
The beggar may gladden life's pathway forlorn,

Though aged and weak he may be.
This castle is mine! thou hast made it thy prey,

Thy people 'twas put me to flight;
The tokens I bear will confirm what I say""--

The children they hear with delight.

""The king who erst govern'd returneth again,
And restores to the Faithful the goods that were ta'en,

I'll unseal all my treasures the while;
The laws shall be gentle, and peaceful the reign""--

""Take courage, my son! all hath turned out for good,

And each hath a star that is bright,
Those the princess hath borne thee are princely in blood,""--

45,Anne Sexton,The Ballad Of The Lonely Masturbator,"The end of the affair is always death. 
She's my workshop. Slippery eye, 
out of the tribe of myself my breath 
finds you gone. I horrify 
those who stand by. I am fed. 
At night, alone, I marry the bed. 
Finger to finger, now she's mine. 
She's not too far. She's my encounter. 
I beat her like a bell. I recline 
in the bower where you used to mount her. 
You borrowed me on the flowered spread. 
At night, alone, I marry the bed. 
Take for instance this night, my love, 
that every single couple puts together 
with a joint overturning, beneath, above, 
the abundant two on sponge and feather, 
kneeling and pushing, head to head. 
At night, alone, I marry the bed. 
I break out of my body this way, 
an annoying miracle. Could I 
put the dream market on display? 
I am spread out. I crucify. 
My little plum is what you said. 
At night, alone, I marry the bed. 
Then my black-eyed rival came. 
The lady of water, rising on the beach, 
a piano at her fingertips, shame 
on her lips and a flute's speech. 
And I was the knock-kneed broom instead. 
At night, alone, I marry the bed. 
She took you the way a women takes 
a bargain dress off the rack 
and I broke the way a stone breaks. 
I give back your books and fishing tack. 
Today's paper says that you are wed. 
At night, alone, I marry the bed. 
The boys and girls are one tonight. 
They unbutton blouses. They unzip flies. 
They take off shoes. They turn off the light. 
The glimmering creatures are full of lies. 
They are eating each other. They are overfed.

46,Henry Lawson,The Ballad Of The Drover,"Across the stony ridges, 
 Across the rolling plain, 
Young Harry Dale, the drover, 
 Comes riding home again. 
And well his stock-horse bears him, 
 And light of heart is he, 
And stoutly his old pack-horse 
 Is trotting by his knee. 
 
Up Queensland way with cattle 
 He travelled regions vast; 
And many months have vanished 
 Since home-folk saw him last. 
He hums a song of someone 
 He hopes to marry soon; 
And hobble-chains and camp-ware 
 Keep jingling to the tune. 
 
Beyond the hazy dado 
 Against the lower skies 
And yon blue line of ranges 
 The homestead station lies. 
And thitherward the drover 
 Jogs through the lazy noon, 
While hobble-chains and camp-ware 
 Are jingling to a tune. 
 
An hour has filled the heavens 
 With storm-clouds inky black; 
At times the lightning trickles 
 Around the drover's track; 
But Harry pushes onward, 
 His horses' strength he tries, 
In hope to reach the river 
 Before the flood shall rise. 
 
The thunder from above him 
 Goes rolling o'er the plain; 
And down on thirsty pastures 
 In torrents falls the rain. 
And every creek and gully 
 Sends forth its little flood, 
Till the river runs a banker, 
 All stained with yellow mud. 
 
Now Harry speaks to Rover, 
 The best dog on the plains, 
And to his hardy horses, 
 And strokes their shaggy manes; 
`We've breasted bigger rivers 
 When floods were at their height 
Nor shall this gutter stop us 
 From getting home to-night!' 
 
The thunder growls a warning, 
 The ghastly lightnings gleam, 
As the drover turns his horses 
 To swim the fatal stream. 
But, oh! the flood runs stronger 
 Than e'er it ran before; 
The saddle-horse is failing, 
 And only half-way o'er! 
 
When flashes next the lightning, 
 The flood's grey breast is blank, 
And a cattle dog and pack-horse 
 Are struggling up the bank. 
But in the lonely homestead 
 The girl will wait in vain -- 
He'll never pass the stations 
 In charge of stock again. 
 
The faithful dog a moment 
 Sits panting on the bank, 
And then swims through the current 
 To where his master sank. 
And round and round in circles 
 He fights with failing strength, 
Till, borne down by the waters, 
 The old dog sinks at length. 
 
Across the flooded lowlands 
 And slopes of sodden loam 
The pack-horse struggles onward, 
 To take dumb tidings home. 
And mud-stained, wet, and weary, 
 Through ranges dark goes he; 
While hobble-chains and tinware 
 Are sounding eerily. 
 
     .    .    .    .    . 
 
The floods are in the ocean, 
 The stream is clear again, 
And now a verdant carpet 
 Is stretched across the plain. 
But someone's eyes are saddened, 
 And someone's heart still bleeds 
In sorrow for the drover 
 Who sleeps among the reeds.",Ballad

48,Sir Henry Newbolt,A Ballad Of John Nicholson,"It fell in the year of Mutiny, 
At darkest of the night, 
John Nicholson by Jal√°ndhar came, 
On his way to Delhi fight. 

And as he by Jal√°ndhar came, 
He thought what he must do, 
And he sent to the Rajah fair greeting, 
To try if he were true. 

""God grant your Highness length of days, 
And friends when need shall be; 
And I pray you send your Captains hither, 
That they may speak with me."" 

On the morrow through Jal√°ndhar town 
The Captains rode in state; 
They came to the house of John Nicholson, 
And stood before the gate. 

The chief of them was Mehtab Singh, 
He was both proud and sly; 
His turban gleamed with rubies red, 
He held his chin full high. 

He marked his fellows how they put 
Their shoes from off their feet; 
""Now wherefore make ye such ado 
These fallen lords to greet? 

""They have ruled us for a hundred years, 
In truth I know not how, 
But though they be fain of mastery 
They dare not claim it now."" 

Right haughtily before them all 
The durbar hall he trod, 
With rubies red his turban gleamed, 
His feet with pride were shod. 

They had not been an hour together, 
A scanty hour or so, 
When Mehtab Singh rose in his place 
And turned about to go. 

Then swiftly came John Nicholson 
Between the door and him, 
With anger smouldering in his eyes, 
That made the rubies dim. 

""You are over-hasty, Mehtab Singh,"" -- 
Oh, but his voice was low! 
He held his wrath with a curb of iron 
That furrowed cheek and brow. 

""You are over-hasty, Mehtab Singh, 
When that the rest are gone, 
I have a word that may not wait 
To speak with you alone."" 

The Captains passed in silence forth 
And stood the door behind; 
To go before the game was played 
Be sure they had no mind. 

But there within John Nicholson 
Turned him on Mehtab Singh, 
""So long as the soul is in my body 
You shall not do this thing. 

""Have ye served us for a hundred years 
And yet ye know not why? 
We brook no doubt of our mastery, 
We rule until we die. 

""Were I the one last Englishman 
Drawing the breath of life, 
And you the master-rebel of all 
That stir this land to strife -- 

""Were I,"" he said, ""but a Corporal, 
And you a Rajput King, 
So long as the soul was in my body 
You should not do this thing. 

""Take off, take off, those shoes of pride, 
Carry them whence they came; 
Your Captains saw your insolence, 
And they shall see your shame."" 

When Mehtab Singh came to the door 
His shoes they burned his hand, 
For there in long and silent lines 
He saw the Captains stand. 

When Mehtab Singh rode from the gate 
His chin was on his breast: 
The captains said, ""When the strong command 
Obedience is best.""",Ballad
49,William Butler Yeats,The Ballad Of The Foxhunter,"'Lay me in a cushioned chair;
Carry me, ye four,
With cushions here and cushions there,
To see the world once more.

'To stable and to kennel go;
Bring what is there to bring;
Lead my Lollard to and fro,
Or gently in a ring.

'Put the chair upon the grass:
Bring Rody and his hounds,
That I may contented pass
From these earthly bounds.'

His eyelids droop, his head falls low,
His old eyes cloud with dreams;
The sun upon all things that grow
Falls in sleepy streams.

Brown Lollard treads upon the lawn,
And to the armchair goes,
And now the old man's dreams are gone,
He smooths the long brown nose.

And now moves many a pleasant tongue
Upon his wasted hands,
For leading aged hounds and young
The huntsman near him stands.

'Huntsmam Rody, blow the horn,
Make the hills reply.'
The huntsman loosens on the morn
A gay wandering cry.

Fire is in the old man's eyes,
His fingers move and sway,
And when the wandering music dies
They hear him feebly say,

'Huntsman Rody, blow the horn,
Make the hills reply.'
'I cannot blow upon my horn,
I can but weep and sigh.'

Servants round his cushioned place
Are with new sorrow wrung;
Hounds are gazing on his face,
Aged hounds and young.

One blind hound only lies apart
On the sun-smitten grass;
He holds deep commune with his heart:
The moments pass and pass:

The blind hound with a mournful din
Lifts slow his wintry head;
The servants bear the body in;
The hounds wail for the dead.",Ballad

Till, passing by a settler's hut,

Then started homewards full of hope, 
Alas, that hopes should fail!

Beneath the horse's tail.

There, don't fling stones at me
Because I mutter as I go;
But pity Moll Magee.
My man was a poor fisher
With shore lines in the say;
My work was saltin' herrings
The whole of the long day.
And sometimes from the Saltin' shed
I scarce could drag my feet,
Under the blessed moonlight,
Along thc pebbly street.
I'd always been but weakly,
And my baby was just born;
A neighbour minded her by day,
I minded her till morn.
I lay upon my baby;
Ye little childer dear,
I looked on my cold baby
When the morn grew frosty and clear.
A weary woman sleeps so hard!
My man grew red and pale,
And gave me money, and bade me go
To my own place, Kinsale.
He drove me out and shut the door.
And gave his curse to me;
I went away in silence,
No neighbour could I see.
The windows and the doors were shut,
One star shone faint and green,
The little straws were turnin round
Across the bare boreen.
I went away in silence:
Beyond old Martin's byre
I saw a kindly neighbour
Blowin' her mornin' fire.
She drew from me my story --
My money's all used up,
And still, with pityin', scornin' eye,
She gives me bite and sup.
She says my man will surely come
And fetch me home agin;
But always, as I'm movin' round,
Without doors or within,
Pilin' the wood or pilin' the turf,
Or goin' to the well,
I'm thinkin' of my baby
And keenin' to mysel'.
And Sometimes I am sure she knows
When, openin' wide His door,
God lights the stats, His candles,
And looks upon the poor.
So now, ye little childer,
Ye won't fling stones at me;
But gather with your shinin' looks
And pity Moll Magee.",Ballad
52,Robert Southey,Donica - A Ballad,"High on a rock, whose castled shade
 Darken'd the lake below,
In ancient strength majestic stood
 The towers of Arlinkow.

The fisher in the lake below
 Durst never cast his net,
Nor ever swallow in its waves
 Her passing wings would wet.

The cattle from its ominous banks
 In wild alarm would run,
Tho' parched with thirst and faint beneath
 The summer's scorching sun.

For sometimes when no passing breeze
 The long lank sedges waved,
All white with foam and heaving high
 Its deafening billows raved;

And when the tempest from its base
 The rooted pine would shake,
The powerless storm unruffling swept
 Across the calm dead lake.

And ever then when Death drew near
 The house of Arlinkow,
Its dark unfathom'd depths did send
 Strange music from below.

The Lord of Arlinkow was old,
 One only child had he,
Donica was the Maiden's name
 As fair as fair might be.

A bloom as bright as opening morn
 Flush'd o'er her clear white cheek,
The music of her voice was mild,
 Her full dark eyes were meek.

Far was her beauty known, for none
 So fair could Finland boast,
Her parents loved the Maiden much,
 Young EBERHARD loved her most.

Together did they hope to tread
 The pleasant path of life,
For now the day drew near to make
 Donica Eberhard's wife.

The eve was fair and mild the air,
 Along the lake they stray;
The eastern hill reflected bright
 The fading tints of day.

And brightly o'er the water stream'd
 The liquid radiance wide;
Donica's little dog ran on
 And gambol'd at her side.

Youth, Health, and Love bloom'd on her cheek,
 Her full dark eyes express
In many a glance to Eberhard
 Her soul's meek tenderness.

Nor sound was heard, nor passing gale
 Sigh'd thro' the long lank sedge,
The air was hushed, no little wave
 Dimpled the water's edge.

Sudden the unfathom'd lake sent forth
 Strange music from beneath,
And slowly o'er the waters sail'd
 The solemn sounds of Death.

As the deep sounds of Death arose,
 Donica's cheek grew pale,
And in the arms of Eberhard
 The senseless Maiden fell.

Loudly the youth in terror shriek'd,
 And loud he call'd for aid,
And with a wild and eager look
 Gaz'd on the death-pale Maid.

But soon again did better thoughts
 In Eberhard arise,
And he with trembling hope beheld
 The Maiden raise her eyes.

And on his arm reclin'd she moved
 With feeble pace and slow,
And soon with strength recover'd reach'd

Yet never to Donica's cheek
 Return'd the lively hue,
Her cheeks were deathy, white, and wan,
 Her lips a livid blue.

Her eyes so bright and black of yore
 Were now more black and bright,
And beam'd strange lustre in her face
 So deadly wan and white.

The dog that gambol'd by her side,
 And lov'd with her to stray,
Now at his alter'd mistress howl'd
 And fled in fear away.

Yet did the faithful Eberhard
 Not love the Maid the less;
He gaz'd with sorrow, but he gaz'd
 With deeper tenderness.

And when he found her health unharm'd
 He would not brook delay,
But press'd the not unwilling Maid
 To fix the bridal day.

And when at length it came, with joy
 They hail'd the bridal day,
And onward to the house of God
 They went their willing way.

And as they at the altar stood
 And heard the sacred rite,
The hallowed tapers dimly stream'd
 A pale sulphureous light.

And as the Youth with holy warmth
 Her hand in his did hold,
Sudden he felt Donica's hand
 Grow deadly damp and cold.

And loudly did he shriek, for lo!
 A Spirit met his view,
And Eberhard in the angel form
 His own Donica knew.

That instant from her earthly frame
 Howling the Daemon fled,
And at the side of Eberhard
 The livid form fell dead.",Ballad
53,William Butler Yeats,The Ballad Of Father O'Hart,"GOOD Father John O'Hart
In penal days rode out
To a Shoneen who had free lands
And his own snipe and trout.
In trust took he John's lands;
Sleiveens were all his race;
And he gave them as dowers to his daughters.
And they married beyond their place.
But Father John went up,
And Father John went down;
And he wore small holes in his Shoes,
And he wore large holes in his gown.
All loved him, only the shoneen,
Whom the devils have by the hair,
From the wives, and the cats, and the children,
To the birds in the white of the air.
The birds, for he opened their cages
As he went up and down;
And he said with a smile, 'Have peace now';
And he went his way with a frown.
But if when anyone died
Came keeners hoarser than rooks,
He bade them give over their keening;
For he was a man of books.
And these were the works of John,
When, weeping score by score,
People came into Colooney;
For he'd died at ninety-four.
There was no human keening;
The birds from Knocknarea
And the world round Knocknashee
Came keening in that day.
The young birds and old birds
Came flying, heavy and sad;
Keening in from Tiraragh,
Keening from Ballinafad;
Keening from Inishmurray.
Nor stayed for bite or sup;
This way were all reproved
Who dig old customs up.",Ballad
54,Zbigniew Herbert,A Ballad That We Do Not Perish,"Those who sailed at dawn
but will never return
left their trace on a wave--

a shell fell to the bottom of the sea
beautiful as lips turned to stone

those who walked on a sandy road
but could not reach the shuttered windows
though they already saw the roofs--

they have found shelter in a bell of air

but those who leave behind only
a room grown cold a few books
an empty inkwell white paper--

in truth they have not completely died
their whisper travels through thickets of wallpaper
their level head still lives in the ceiling

their paradise was made of air
of water lime and earth an angel of wind
will pulverize the body in its hand
they will be
carried over the meadows of this world",Ballad
55,John Gay,Sweet William's Farewell To Black-Ey'D S..,"1       All in the Downs the fleet was moor'd,
2         The streamers waving in the wind,
3     When black-ey'd Susan came aboard.
4         Oh! where shall I my true love find!
5     Tell me, ye jovial sailors, tell me true,
6     If my sweet William sails among the crew.

7       William, who high upon the yard,
8         Rock'd with the billow to and fro,
9     Soon as her well-known voice he heard,
10       He sigh'd, and cast his eyes below:
11   The cord slides swiftly through his glowing hands,
12   And, (quick as lightning) on the deck he stands.

13     So the sweet lark, high pois'd in air,
14       Shuts close his pinions to his breast,
15   (If, chance, his mate's shrill call he hear)
16       And drops at once into her nest.
17   The noblest captain in the British fleet,
18   Might envy William's lip those kisses sweet.

19     'O Susan, Susan, lovely dear,
20       My vows shall ever true remain;
21   Let me kiss off that falling tear,
22       We only part to meet again.
23   Change, as ye list, ye winds; my heart shall be
24   The faithful compass that still points to thee.

25     'Believe not what the landmen say,
26       Who tempt with doubts thy constant mind:
27   They'll tell thee, sailors, when away,
28       In ev'ry port a mistress find.
29   Yes, yes, believe them when they tell thee so,
30   For thou art present wheresoe'er I go.

31     'If to far India's coast we sail,
32       Thy eyes are seen in di'monds bright,
33   Thy breath is Afric's spicy gale,
34       Thy skin is ivory, so white.
35   Thus ev'ry beauteous object that I view,
36   Wakes in my soul some charm of lovely Sue.

37     'Though battle call me from thy arms
38       Let not my pretty Susan mourn;
39   Though cannons roar, yet safe from harms,
40       William shall to his dear return.
41   Love turns aside the balls that round me fly,
42   Lest precious tears should drop from Susan's eye'.

43     The boatswain gave the dreadful word,
44       The sails their swelling bosom spread,
45   No longer must she stay aboard:
46       They kiss'd, she sigh'd, he hung his head.
47   Her less'ning boat, unwilling rows to land:
48   'Adieu', she cries! and wav'd her lily hand.",Ballad
56,Rudyard Kipling,Ballad Of Fisher's Boarding-House,"'T was Fultah Fisher's boarding-house,
Where sailor-men reside,
And there were men of all the ports
From Mississip to Clyde,
And regally they spat and smoked,
And fearsomely they lied.

They lied about the purple Sea
That gave them scanty bread,
They lied about the Earth beneath,
The Heavens overhead,
For they had looked too often on
Black rum when that was red.

They told their tales of wreck and wrong,
Of shame and lust and fraud,
They backed their toughest statements with
The Brimstone of the Lord,
And crackling oaths went to and fro
Across the fist-banged board.

And there was Hans the blue-eyed Dane,
Bull-throated, bare of arm,
Who carried on his hairy chest
The maid Ultruda's charm --
The little silver crucifix
That keeps a man from harm.

And there was Jake Without-the-Ears,
And Pamba the Malay,
And Carboy Gin the Guinea cook,
And Luz from Vigo Bay,
And Honest Jack who sold them slops
And harvested their pay.

And there was Salem Hardieker,
A lean Bostonian he --
Russ, German, English, Halfbreed, Finn,
Yank, Dane, and Portugee,
At Fultah Fisher's boarding-house
They rested from the sea.

Now Anne of Austria shared their drinks,
Collinga knew her fame,
From Tarnau in Galicia
To Juan Bazaar she came,
To eat the bread of infamy
And take the wage of shame.

She held a dozen men to heel --
Rich spoil of war was hers,
In hose and gown and ring and chain,
From twenty mariners,
And, by Port Law, that week, men called
Her Salem Hardieker's.

But seamen learnt -- what landsmen know --
That neither gifts nor gain
Can hold a winking Light o' Love
Or Fancy's flight restrain,
When Anne of Austria rolled her eyes
On Hans the blue-eyed Dane.

Since Life is strife, and strife means knife,
From Howrah to the Bay,
And he may die before the dawn
Who liquored out the day,
In Fultah Fisher's boarding-house
We woo while yet we may.

But cold was Hans the blue-eyed Dane,
Bull-throated, bare of arm,
And laughter shook the chest beneath
The maid Ultruda's charm --
The little silver crucifix
That keeps a man from harm.

""You speak to Salem Hardieker;
""You was his girl, I know.
""I ship mineselfs to-morrow, see,
""Und round the Skaw we go,
""South, down the Cattegat, by Hjelm,
""To Besser in Saro.""

When love rejected turns to hate,
All ill betide the man.
""You speak to Salem Hardieker"" --
She spoke as woman can.
A scream -- a sob -- ""He called me -- names!""
And then the fray began.

An oath from Salem Hardieker,
A shriek upon the stairs,
A dance of shadows on the wall,
A knife-thrust unawares --
And Hans came down, as cattle drop,
Across the broken chairs.

. . . . . .

In Anne of Austria's trembling hands
The weary head fell low: --
""I ship mineselfs to-morrow, straight
""For Besser in Saro;
""Und there Ultruda comes to me
""At Easter, und I go

""South, down the Cattegat -- What's here?
""There -- are -- no -- lights -- to guide!""
The mutter ceased, the spirit passed,
And Anne of Austria cried
In Fultah Fisher's boarding-house
When Hans the mighty died.

Thus slew they Hans the blue-eyed Dane,
Bull-throated, bare of arm,
But Anne of Austria looted first
The maid Ultruda's charm --
The little silver crucifix
That keeps a man from harm.",Ballad
57,Ellis Parker Butler,The Ballad Of A Bachelor,"Listen, ladies, while I sing
The ballad of John Henry King.

John Henry was a bachelor,
His age was thirty-three or four.

Two maids for his affection vied,
And each desired to be his bride,

And bravely did they strive to bring
Unto their feet John Henry King.

John Henry liked them both so well,
To save his life he could not tell

Which he most wished to be his bride,
Nor was he able to decide.

Fair Kate was jolly, bright, and gay,
And sunny as a summer day;

Marie was kind, sedate, and sweet,
With gentle ways and manners neat.

Each was so dear that John confessed
He could not tell which he liked best.

He studied them for quite a year,
And still found no solution near,

And might have studied two years more
Had he not, walking on the shore,

Conceived a very simple way
Of ending his prolonged delay--

A way in which he might decide
Which of the maids should be his bride.

He said, ""I'll toss into the air
A dollar, and I'll toss it fair;

If heads come up, I'll wed Marie;
If tails, fair Kate my bride shall be.""

Then from his leather pocket-book
A dollar bright and new he took;

He kissed one side for fair Marie,
The other side for Kate kissed he.

Then in a manner free and fair
He tossed the dollar in the air.

""Ye fates,"" he cried, ""pray let this be
A lucky throw indeed for me!""

The dollar rose, the dollar fell;
He watched its whirling transit well,

And off some twenty yards or more
The dollar fell upon the shore.

John Henry ran to where it struck
To see which maiden was in luck.

But, oh, the irony of fate!
Upon its edge the coin stood straight!

And there, embedded in the sand,
John Henry let the dollar stand!

And he will tempt his fate no more,
But live and die a bachelor.

Thus, ladies, you have heard me sing
The ballad of John Henry King.

60,Michael Drayton,Ode To The Cambro-Britons And Their Harp..,"Fair stood the wind for France,
   When we our sails advance;
   Nor now to prove our chance
       Longer will tarry;
   But putting to the main,
   At Caux, the mouth of Seine,
   With all his martial train
       Landed King Harry.

   And taking many a fort,
  Furnish'd in warlike sort,
  Marcheth towards Agincourt
      In happy hour;
  Skirmishing day by day
  With those that stopp'd his way,
  Where the French gen'ral lay
      With all his power.

  Which, in his height of pride,
  King Henry to deride,
  His ransom to provide
      To the King sending;
  Which he neglects the while,
  As from a nation vile
  Yet with an angry smile
      Their fall portending.

  And turning to his men
  Quoth our brave Henry then:
  ""Though they to one be ten
      Be not amazed.
  Yet have we well begun:
  Battles so bravely won
  Have ever to the sun
      By Fame been raised!

  ""And for myself,"" quoth he,
  ""This my full rest shall be:
  England ne'er mourn for me,
      Nor more esteem me;
  Victor I will remain,
  Or on this earth lie slain;
  Never shall she sustain
      Loss to redeem me!

  ""Poitiers and Cressy tell
  When most their pride did swell
  Under our swords they fell;
      No less our skill is
  Than when our grandsire great,
  Claiming the regal seat,
  By many a warlike feat
      Lopp'd the French lilies.""

  The Duke of York so dread
  The eager vaward led;
  With the main Henry sped
      Amongst his henchmen:
  Excester had the rear,
  A braver man not there
  O Lord, how hot they were
      On the false Frenchmen!

  They now to fight are gone;
  Armour on armour shone;
  Drum now to drum did groan:
       To hear, was wonder;
  That, with cries they make,
  The very earth did shake;
  Trumpet to trumpet spake,
      Thunder to thunder.

  Well it thine age became,
  O noble Erpingham,
  Which didst the signal aim
      To our hid forces;
  When, from a meadow by,
  Like a storm suddenly,
  The English archery
      Stuck the French horses

  With Spanish yew so strong,
  Arrows a cloth-yard long,
  That like to serpents stung,
      Piercing the weather.
  None from his fellow starts,
  But playing manly parts,
  And like true English hearts
      Stuck close together.

  When down their bows they threw,
  And forth their bilboes drew,
  And on the French they flew,
      Not one was tardy;
  Arms were from shoulders sent,
  Scalps to the teeth were rent,
  Down the French peasants went:
      Our men were hardy.

  This while our noble King,
  His broad sword brandishing,
  Down the French host did ding,
      As to o'erwhelm it.
  And many a deep wound lent,
  His arms with blood besprent,
  And many a cruel dent
      Bruised his helmet.

  Gloster, that duke so good,
  Next of the royal blood,
  For famous England stood
    With his brave brother.
 Clarence, in steel so bright,
 Though but a maiden knight,
 Yet in that furious fight
    Scarce such another!

 Warwick in blood did wade,
 Oxford the foe invade,
 And cruel slaughter made,
    Still as they ran up.
 Suffolk his axe did ply;
 Beaumont and Willoughby
 Bare them right doughtily;
    Ferrers and Fanhope.

 Upon Saint Crispin's Day
 Fought was this noble fray,
 Which fame did not delay
    To England to carry.

Alas the joy, the sorrow, and the scorn, 
That clothed thy life with hopes and sins and fears, 
And gave thee stones for bread and tares for corn

Till shifts came short and loves were hard to hire, 
When lilt of song nor twitch of twangling wire 
Could buy thee bread or kisses; when light fame 
Spurned like a ball and haled through brake and briar,

Poor kind wild eyes so dashed with light quick tears!

What far delight has cooled the fierce desire 
That like some ravenous bird was strong to tire 
On that frail flesh and soul consumed with flame, 
But left more sweet than roses to respire, 
Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name? 


Prince of sweet songs made out of tears and fire,

""The Australian has got no land of his own, 
His home is England, and there alone."" 

So he strutted along with the titled band 
And he sold the pride of his native land 
For a bow and a smile and a shake of the hand.

Of the people
Who will save your soul
For our souls are pure
Our souls sing this ballad
The ballad of the night
The ballad of the pure hearts",Ballad
66,Paul Laurence Dunbar,A Border Ballad,"OH, I haven't got long to live, for we all
Die soon, e'en those who live longest;
And the poorest and weakest are taking their chance
Along with the richest and strongest.
So it's heigho for a glass and a song,
And a bright eye over the table,
And a dog for the hunt when the game is flush.
And the pick of a gentleman's stable.
There is Dimmock o' Dune, he was here yesternight,
But he's rotting to-day on Glen Arragh;
'Twas the hand o' MacPherson that gave him the blow,
And the vultures shall feast on his marrow.
But it's heigho for a brave old song
And a glass while we are able;
Here's a health to death and another cup
To the bright eye over the table.
I can show a broad back and a jolly deep chest,
But who argues now on appearance?
A blow or a thrust or a stumble at best
May send me to-day to my clearance.
Then it's heigho for the things I love,
My mother'll be soon wearing sable,
But give me my horse and my dog and my glass,
And a bright eye over the table.",Ballad
67,Banjo Paterson,The Ballad Of Cockatoo Dock,"Of all the docks upon the blue 
There was no dockyard, old or new, 
To touch the dock at Cockatoo. 

Of all the ministerial clan 
There was no nicer, worthier man 
Than Admiral O'Sullivan. 

Of course, we mean E. W. 
O'Sullivan, the hero who 
Controlled the dock at Cockatoo. 

To workmen he explained his views -- 
""You need not toil unless you choose, 
Your only work is drawing screws."" 

And sometimes to their great surprise 
When votes of censure filled the skies 
He used to give them all a rise. 

""What odds about a pound or two?"" 
Exclaimed the great E. W. 
O'Sullivan at Cockatoo. 

The dockyard superintendent, he 
Was not at all what he should be -- 
He sneered at all this sympathy. 

So when he gave a man the sack 
O'Sullivan got on his track 
And straightway went and fetched him back. 

And with a sympathetic tear 
He'd say, ""How dare you interfere, 
You most misguided engineer? 

""Your sordid manners please amend -- 
No man can possibly offend 
Who has a Member for a friend. 

""With euchre, or a friendly rub, 
And whisky, from the nearest 'pub', 
We'll make the dockyard like a club. 

""Heave ho, my hearties, play away, 
We'll do no weary work today. 
What odds -- the public has to pay! 

""And if the public should complain 
I'll go to Broken Hill by train 
To watch McCarthy making rain."" 

And there, with nothing else to do 
No doubt the great E. W. 
Will straightway raise McCarthy's screw.",Ballad
68,Alexander Pope,The Challenge: A Court Ballad,"I.

And wit and love no sin!

To Bellenden, Lepell, and Griffin.
With a fa, la, la.

And what behind the scene,
Couches and crippled chairs I know,
And garrets hung with green;
I know the swing of sinful hack,
Where many damsels cry alack.

III.
Then why to Courts should I repair,
Where's such ado with Townsend?
To hear each mortal stamp and swear,
And every speech with 'Zounds' end;
To hear them rail at honest Sunderland,
And rashly blame the realm of Blunderland.

Like Grafton court the Germans;
Tell Pickenbourg how slim she's grown,
Like Meadows run to sermons;

To armies that are standing;

69,Banjo Paterson,The Ballad Of The Calliope,"By the far Samoan shore, 
Where the league-long rollers pour 
All the wash of the Pacific on the coral-guarded bay, 
Riding lightly at their ease, 
In the calm of tropic seas, 
The three great nations' warships at their anchors proudly lay. 
Riding lightly, head to wind, 
With the coral reefs behind, 
Three German and three Yankee ships were mirrored in the blue; 
And on one ship unfurled 
Was the flag that rules the world -- 
For on the old Calliope the flag of England flew. 

When the gentle off-shore breeze, 
That had scarcely stirred the trees, 
Dropped down to utter stillness, and the glass began to fall, 
Away across the main 
Lowered the coming hurricane, 
And far away to seaward hung the cloud-wrack like a pall. 

If the word had passed around, 
""Let us move to safer ground; 
Let us steam away to seaward"" -- then his tale were not to tell! 
But each Captain seemed to say 
""If the others stay, I stay!"" 
And they lingered at their moorings till the shades of evening fell. 

Then the cloud-wrack neared them fast, 
And there came a sudden blast, 
And the hurricane came leaping down a thousand miles of main! 
Like a lion on its prey, 
Leapt the storm fiend on the bay, 
And the vessels shook and shivered as their cables felt the strain. 

As the surging seas came by, 
That were running mountains high, 
The vessels started dragging, drifting slowly to the lee; 
And the darkness of the night 
Hid the coral reefs from sight, 
And the Captains dared not risk the chance to grope their way to sea. 

In the dark they dared not shift! 
They were forced to wait and drift; 
All hands stood by uncertain would the anchors hold or no. 
But the men on deck could see, 
If a chance for them might be, 
There was little chance of safety for the men who were below. 

Through that long, long night of dread, 
While the storm raged overhead, 
They were waiting by their engines, with the furnace fires aroar; 
So they waited, staunch and true, 
Though they knew, and well they knew, 
They must drown like rats imprisoned if the vessel touched the shore. 

When the grey dawn broke at last, 
And the long, long night was past, 
While the hurricane redoubled, lest its prey should steal away, 
On the rocks, all smashed and strown, 
Were the German vessels thrown, 
While the Yankees, swamped and helpless, drifted shorewards down the bay. 

Then at last spoke Captain Kane, 
""All our anchors are in vain, 
And the Germans and the Yankees they have drifted to the lee! 
Cut the cables at the bow! 
We must trust the engines now! 
Give her steam, and let her have it, lads! we'll fight her out to sea!"" 

And the answer came with cheers 
From the stalwart engineers, 
From the grim and grimy firemen at the furnaces below; 
And above the sullen roar 
Of the breakers on the shore 
Came the throbbing of the engines as they laboured to and fro. 

If the strain should find a flaw, 
Should a bolt or rivet draw, 
Then -- God help them! for the vessel were a plaything in the tide! 
With a face of honest cheer 
Quoth an English engineer, 
""I will answer for the engiines that were built on old Thames-side! 

""For the stays and stanchions taut, 
For the rivets truly wrought, 
For the valves that fit their faces as a glove should fit the hand. 
Give her every ounce of power; 
If we make a knot an hour 
Then it's way enough to steer her, and we'll drive her from the land."" 

Life a foam-flake tossed and thrown, 
She could barely hold her own, 
While the other ships all helplessly were drifting to the lee. 
Through the smother and the rout 
The Calliope steamed out -- 
And they cheered her from the Trenton that was foundering in the sea. 

Ay! drifting shoreward there, 
All helpless as they were, 
Their vessel hurled upon the reefs as weed ashore is hurled, 
Without a thought of fear 
The Yankees raised a cheer -- 
A cheer that English-speaking folk should echo round the world.",Ballad
70,Rudyard Kipling,The Ballad Of East And West,"Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,
     Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God's great Judgment Seat;
     But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,
     When two strong men stand face to face,
       tho' they come from the ends of the earth!
 
Kamal is out with twenty men to raise the Border-side,
And he has lifted the Colonel's mare that is the Colonel's pride:
He has lifted her out of the stable-door between the dawn and the day,
And turned the calkins upon her feet, and ridden her far away.
Then up and spoke the Colonel's son that led a troop of the Guides:
""Is there never a man of all my men can say where Kamal hides?""
Then up and spoke Mahommed Khan, the son of the Ressaldar:
""If ye know the track of the morning-mist, ye know where his pickets are.
At dusk he harries the Abazai -- at dawn he is into Bonair,
But he must go by Fort Bukloh to his own place to fare,
So if ye gallop to Fort Bukloh as fast as a bird can fly,
By the favour of God ye may cut him off ere he win to the Tongue of Jagai.
But if he be past the Tongue of Jagai, right swiftly turn ye then,
For the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with Kamal's men.
There is rock to the left, and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between,
And ye may hear a breech-bolt snick where never a man is seen.""
The Colonel's son has taken a horse, and a raw rough dun was he,
With the mouth of a bell and the heart of Hell
  and the head of the gallows-tree.
The Colonel's son to the Fort has won, they bid him stay to eat --
Who rides at the tail of a Border thief, he sits not long at his meat.
He's up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can fly,
Till he was aware of his father's mare in the gut of the Tongue of Jagai,
Till he was aware of his father's mare with Kamal upon her back,
And when he could spy the white of her eye, he made the pistol crack.
He has fired once, he has fired twice, but the whistling ball went wide.
""Ye shoot like a soldier,"" Kamal said.  ""Show now if ye can ride.""
It's up and over the Tongue of Jagai, as blown dustdevils go,
The dun he fled like a stag of ten, but the mare like a barren doe.
The dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above,
But the red mare played with the snaffle-bars, as a maiden plays with a glove.
There was rock to the left and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between,
And thrice he heard a breech-bolt snick tho' never a man was seen.
They have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their hoofs drum up the dawn,
The dun he went like a wounded bull, but the mare like a new-roused fawn.
The dun he fell at a water-course -- in a woful heap fell he,
And Kamal has turned the red mare back, and pulled the rider free.
He has knocked the pistol out of his hand -- small room was there to strive,
""'Twas only by favour of mine,"" quoth he, ""ye rode so long alive:
There was not a rock for twenty mile, there was not a clump of tree,
But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee.
If I had raised my bridle-hand, as I have held it low,
The little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row:
If I had bowed my head on my breast, as I have held it high,
The kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly.""
Lightly answered the Colonel's son:  ""Do good to bird and beast,
But count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast.
If there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away,
Belike the price of a jackal's meal were more than a thief could pay.
They will feed their horse on the standing crop,
  their men on the garnered grain,
The thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slain.
But if thou thinkest the price be fair, -- thy brethren wait to sup,
The hound is kin to the jackal-spawn, -- howl, dog, and call them up!
And if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and stack,
Give me my father's mare again, and I'll fight my own way back!""
Kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet.
""No talk shall be of dogs,"" said he, ""when wolf and gray wolf meet.
May I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath;
What dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death?""
Lightly answered the Colonel's son:  ""I hold by the blood of my clan:
Take up the mare for my father's gift -- by God, she has carried a man!""
The red mare ran to the Colonel's son, and nuzzled against his breast;
""We be two strong men,"" said Kamal then, ""but she loveth the younger best.
So she shall go with a lifter's dower, my turquoise-studded rein,
My broidered saddle and saddle-cloth, and silver stirrups twain.""
The Colonel's son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end,
""Ye have taken the one from a foe,"" said he;
  ""will ye take the mate from a friend?""
""A gift for a gift,"" said Kamal straight; ""a limb for the risk of a limb.
Thy father has sent his son to me, I'll send my son to him!""
With that he whistled his only son, that dropped from a mountain-crest --
He trod the ling like a buck in spring, and he looked like a lance in rest.
""Now here is thy master,"" Kamal said, ""who leads a troop of the Guides,
And thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides.
Till Death or I cut loose the tie, at camp and board and bed,
Thy life is his -- thy fate it is to guard him with thy head.
So, thou must eat the White Queen's meat, and all her foes are thine,
And thou must harry thy father's hold for the peace of the Border-line,
And thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power --
Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur.""
 
They have looked each other between the eyes, and there they found no fault,
They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on leavened bread and salt:
They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on fire and fresh-cut sod,
On the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife, and the Wondrous Names of God.
The Colonel's son he rides the mare and Kamal's boy the dun,
And two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one.
And when they drew to the Quarter-Guard, full twenty swords flew clear --
There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer.
""Ha' done! ha' done!"" said the Colonel's son.
  ""Put up the steel at your sides!
Last night ye had struck at a Border thief --
  to-night 'tis a man of the Guides!""
 
     Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,

71,Emily Pauline Johnson,The Ballad Of Yaada (A Legend Of The Pac..,"There are fires on Lulu Island, and the sky is opalescent 
 With the pearl and purple tinting from the smouldering of peat. 
And the Dream Hills lift their summits in a sweeping, hazy crescent, 
 With the Capilano canyon at their feet. 

There are fires on Lulu Island, and the smoke, uplifting, lingers 
 In a faded scarf of fragrance as it creeps across the day, 
And the Inlet and the Narrows blur beneath its silent fingers, 
 And the canyon is enfolded in its grey. 

But the sun its face is veiling like a cloistered nun at vespers; 
 As towards the alter candles of the night a censer swings, 
And the echo of tradition wakes from slumbering and whispers, 
 Where the Capilano river sobs and sings. 

It was Yaada, lovely Yaada, who first taught the stream its sighing, 
 For 'twas silent till her coming, and 'twas voiceless as the shore; 
But throughout the great forever it will sing the song undying 
 That the lips of lovers sing for evermore. 

He was chief of all the Squamish, and he ruled the coastal waters-- 
 And he warred upon her people in the distant Charlotte Isles; 
She, a winsome basket weaver, daintiest of Haida daughters, 
 Made him captive to her singing and her smiles. 

Till his hands forgot to havoc and his weapons lost their lusting, 
 Till his stormy eyes allured her from the land of Totem Poles, 
Till she followed where he called her, followed with a woman's trusting, 
 To the canyon where the Capilano rolls. 

And the women of the Haidas plied in vain their magic power, 
 Wailed for many moons her absence, wailed for many moons their prayer,",Ballad

73,Henry Lawson,Ballad Of The Drover,"Across the stony ridges, 
Across the rolling plain, 
Young Harry Dale, the drover, 
Comes riding home again. 
And well his stock-horse bears him, 
And light of heart is he, 
And stoutly his old pack-horse 
Is trotting by his knee. 

Up Queensland way with cattle 
He travelled regions vast; 
And many months have vanished 
Since home-folk saw him last. 
He hums a song of someone 
He hopes to marry soon; 
And hobble-chains and camp-ware 
Keep jingling to the tune. 

Beyond the hazy dado 
Against the lower skies 
And yon blue line of ranges 
The homestead station lies. 
And thitherward the drover 
Jogs through the lazy noon, 
While hobble-chains and camp-ware 
Are jingling to a tune. 

An hour has filled the heavens 
With storm-clouds inky black; 
At times the lightning trickles 
Around the drover's track; 
But Harry pushes onward, 
His horses' strength he tries, 
In hope to reach the river 
Before the flood shall rise. 

The thunder from above him 
Goes rolling o'er the plain; 
And down on thirsty pastures 
In torrents falls the rain. 
And every creek and gully 
Sends forth its little flood, 
Till the river runs a banker, 
All stained with yellow mud. 

Now Harry speaks to Rover, 
The best dog on the plains, 
And to his hardy horses, 
And strokes their shaggy manes; 
`We've breasted bigger rivers 
When floods were at their height 
Nor shall this gutter stop us 
From getting home to-night!' 

The thunder growls a warning, 
The ghastly lightnings gleam, 
As the drover turns his horses 
To swim the fatal stream. 
But, oh! the flood runs stronger 
Than e'er it ran before; 
The saddle-horse is failing, 
And only half-way o'er! 

When flashes next the lightning, 
The flood's grey breast is blank, 
And a cattle dog and pack-horse 
Are struggling up the bank. 
But in the lonely homestead 
The girl will wait in vain - 
He'll never pass the stations 
In charge of stock again. 

The faithful dog a moment 
Sits panting on the bank, 
And then swims through the current 
To where his master sank. 
And round and round in circles 
He fights with failing strength, 
Till, borne down by the waters, 
The old dog sinks at length. 

Across the flooded lowlands 
And slopes of sodden loam 
The pack-horse struggles onward, 
To take dumb tidings home. 
And mud-stained, wet, and weary, 
Through ranges dark goes he; 
While hobble-chains and tinware 
Are sounding eerily. 

The floods are in the ocean, 
The stream is clear again, 
And now a verdant carpet 
Is stretched across the plain. 
But someone's eyes are saddened, 
And someone's heart still bleeds 
In sorrow for the drover 
Who sleeps among the reeds.",Ballad

   ""That I am truly blest, then, say!""

""The immortals' favor thou hast known!
Thy sceptre's might has overthrown
   All those who once were like to thee.
Yet to avenge them one lives still;
I cannot call thee blest, until
   That dreaded foe has ceased to be.""

While to these words the king gave vent,
A herald from Miletus sent,
   Appeared before the tyrant there:
""Lord, let thy incense rise to-day,
And with the laurel branches gay
   Thou well may'st crown thy festive hair!""

""Thy foe has sunk beneath the spear,--
I'm sent to bear the glad news here,
   By thy true marshal Polydore""--
Then from a basin black he takes--
The fearful sight their terror wakes--
   A well-known head, besmeared with gore.

The king with horror stepped aside,
And then with anxious look replied:
   ""Thy bliss to fortune ne'er commit.
On faithless waves, bethink thee how
Thy fleet with doubtful fate swims now--
   How soon the storm may scatter it!""

But ere he yet had spoke the word,
A shout of jubilee is heard
   Resounding from the distant strand.
With foreign treasures teeming o'er,
The vessels' mast-rich wood once more
   Returns home to its native land.

The guest then speaks with startled mind:
""Fortune to-day, in truth, seems kind;
   But thou her fickleness shouldst fear:
The Cretan hordes, well skilled, in arms,
Now threaten thee with war's alarms;
   E'en now they are approaching here.""

And, ere the word has 'scaped his lips,
A stir is seen amongst the ships,
   And thousand voices ""Victory!"" cry:
""We are delivered from our foe,
The storm has laid the Cretan low,
   The war is ended, is gone by!""

The shout with horror hears the guest:
""In truth, I must esteem thee blest!
   Yet dread I the decrees of heaven.
The envy of the gods I fear;
To taste of unmixed rapture here
   Is never to a mortal given.""

""With me, too, everything succeeds;
In all my sovereign acts and deeds
   The grace of Heaven is ever by;
And yet I had a well-loved heir--
I paid my debt to fortune there--
   God took him hence--I saw him die.""

""Wouldst thou from sorrow, then, be free.
Pray to each unseen Deity,
   For thy well-being, grief to send;
The man on whom the Gods bestow
Their gifts with hands that overflow,
   Comes never to a happy end.""

""And if the Gods thy prayer resist,
Then to a friend's instruction list,--
   Invoke thyself adversity;
And what, of all thy treasures bright,
Gives to thy heart the most delight--
   That take and cast thou in the sea!""

Then speaks the other, moved by fear:
""This ring to me is far most dear
   Of all this isle within it knows--
I to the furies pledge it now,
If they will happiness allow""--
   And in the flood the gem he throws.

And with the morrow's earliest light,
Appeared before the monarch's sight
   A fisherman, all joyously;
""Lord, I this fish just now have caught,
No net before e'er held the sort;
   And as a gift I bring it thee.""

The fish was opened by the cook,
Who suddenly, with wondering look,
   Runs up, and utters these glad sounds:
""Within the fish's maw, behold,
I've found, great lord, thy ring of gold!
   Thy fortune truly knows no bounds!""

The guest with terror turned away:
""I cannot here, then, longer stay,--
   My friend thou canst no longer be!
The gods have willed that thou shouldst die:
Lest I, too, perish, I must fly""--
   He spoke,--and sailed thence hastily.",Ballad
76,Sir Walter Scott,Elspeth's Ballad,"The herring loves the merry moon-light,
The mackerel loves the wind,
But the oyster loves the dredging sang,
For they come of a gentle kind.

Now haud your tongue, baith wife and carle,
And listen great and sma',
And I will sing of Glenallan's Earl
That fought on the red Harlaw.

The cronach's cried on Bennachie,
And doun the Don and a',
And hieland and lawland may mournfu' be
For the sair field of Harlaw.--

They saddled a hundred milk-white steeds,
They hae bridled a hundred black,
With a chafron of steel on each horse's head,
And a good knight upon his back.

They hadna ridden a mile, a mile,
A mile, but barely ten,
When Donald came branking down the brae
Wi' twenty thousand men.

Their tartans they were waving wide,
Their glaives were glancing clear,
The pibrochs rung frae side to side,
Would deafen ye to hear.

The great Earl in his stirrups stood,
That Highland host to see:
'Now here a knight that's stout and good
May prove a jeopardie:

'What would'st thou do, my squire so gay,
That rides beside my reyne,-
Were ye Glenallan's Earl the day,
And I were Ronald Cheyne?

'To turn the rein were sin and shame,
To fight were wond'rous peril,-
What would ye do now, Roland Cheyne,
Were ye Glenallan's Earl?'-

'Were I Glenallan's Earl this tide,
And ye were Roland Cheyne,
The spear should be in my horse's side,
And the bridle upon his mane.

'If they hae twenty thousand blades,
And we twice ten times ten,
Yet they hae but their tartan plaids,
And we are mail-clad men.

'My horse shall ride through ranks sae rude,
As through the moorland fern,-
Then ne'er let the gentle Norman blude
Grow cauld for Highland kerne.'

Said, Scorn na at my mither;

Your gift is precious to me, 
With it I will never part.

78,Percy Bysshe Shelley,Sister Rosa: A Ballad,"I.
The death-bell beats!--
The mountain repeats
The echoing sound of the knell;
And the dark Monk now
Wraps the cowl round his brow,
As he sits in his lonely cell.

II.
And the cold hand of death
Chills his shuddering breath,
As he lists to the fearful lay
Which the ghosts of the sky,
As they sweep wildly by,
Sing to departed day.
And they sing of the hour
When the stern fates had power
To resolve Rosa‚Äôs form to its clay.

III.
But that hour is past;
And that hour was the last
Of peace to the dark Monk‚Äôs brain.
Bitter tears, from his eyes, gushed silent and fast;
And he strove to suppress them in vain. 

IV.
Then his fair cross of gold he dashed on the floor,
When the death-knell struck on his ear.--
'Delight is in store
For her evermore;
But for me is fate, horror, and fear.'

V.
Then his eyes wildly rolled,
When the death-bell tolled,
And he raged in terrific woe.
And he stamped on the ground,--
But when ceased the sound,
Tears again began to flow.

VI.
And the ice of despair
Chilled the wild throb of care,
And he sate in mute agony still;
Till the night-stars shone through the cloudless air,
And the pale moonbeam slept on the hill.

VII.
Then he knelt in his cell:--
And the horrors of hell
Were delights to his agonized pain,
And he prayed to God to dissolve the spell, 
Which else must for ever remain.

VIII.
And in fervent pray'r he knelt on the ground,
Till the abbey bell struck One:
His feverish blood ran chill at the sound:
A voice hollow and horrible murmured around--
'The term of thy penance is done!'

IX.
Grew dark the night;
The moonbeam bright
Waxed faint on the mountain high;
And, from the black hill, 
Went a voice cold and still,--
'Monk! thou art free to die.'

X.
Then he rose on his feet,
And his heart loud did beat,
And his limbs they were palsied with dread; 
Whilst the grave's clammy dew
O'er his pale forehead grew;
And he shuddered to sleep with the dead.

XI.
And the wild midnight storm
Raved around his tall form, 
As he sought the chapel's gloom:
And the sunk grass did sigh
To the wind, bleak and high,
As he searched for the new-made tomb.

XII.
And forms, dark and high, 
Seemed around him to fly,
And mingle their yells with the blast:
And on the dark wall
Half-seen shadows did fall,
As enhorrored he onward passed.

XIII.
And the storm-fiends wild rave
O‚Äôer the new-made grave,
And dread shadows linger around.
The Monk called on God his soul to save,
And, in horror, sank on the ground. 

XIV.
Then despair nerved his arm
To dispel the charm,
And he burst Rosa's coffin asunder.
And the fierce storm did swell
More terrific and fell,
And louder pealed the thunder.

XV.
And laughed, in joy, the fiendish throng,
Mixed with ghosts of the mouldering dead:
And their grisly wings, as they floated along,
Whistled in murmurs dread.

XVI.
And her skeleton form the dead Nun reared
Which dripped with the chill dew of hell.
In her half-eaten eyeballs two pale flames appeared,
And triumphant their gleam on the dark Monk glared,
As he stood within the cell. 

XVII.
And her lank hand lay on his shuddering brain;
But each power was nerved by fear.--
'I never, henceforth, may breathe again;
Death now ends mine anguished pain.--
The grave yawns,--we meet there.'

XVIII.
And her skeleton lungs did utter the sound,
So deadly, so lone, and so fell,
That in long vibrations shuddered the ground;
And as the stern notes floated around,
A deep groan was answered from hell.",Ballad
79,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,Water Ballad,"Come hither, gently rowing,
Come, bear me quickly o'er
This stream so brightly flowing
To yonder woodland shore.
But vain were my endeavour
To pay thee, courteous guide;
Row on, row on, for ever
I'd have thee by my side.

Good boatman, prithee haste thee,
I seek my father-land. --
Say, when I there have placed thee,
Dare I demand thy hand?
A maiden's head can never
So hard a point decide;
Row on, row on, for ever
I'd have thee by my side.

The happy bridal over
The wanderer ceased to roam,
For, seated by her lover,
The boat became her home.
And they still sang together
As steering o'er the tide:
Row on through wind and weather
For ever by my side.",Ballad
80,Delmore Schwartz,The Ballad Of The Children Of The Czar,"1
 
The children of the Czar
Played with a bouncing ball

In the May morning, in the Czar's garden,
Tossing it back and forth.

It fell among the flowerbeds
Or fled to the north gate.

A daylight moon hung up
In the Western sky, bald white.

Like Papa's face, said Sister,
Hurling the white ball forth.

        2

While I ate a baked potato
Six thousand miles apart,

In Brooklyn, in 1916,
Aged two, irrational.

When Franklin D. Roosevelt
Was an Arrow Collar ad.

O Nicholas! Alas! Alas!
My grandfather coughed in your army,

Hid in a wine-stinking barrel,
For three days in Bucharest

Then left for America
To become a king himself.

        3
 
I am my father's father,
You are your children's guilt.

In history's pity and terror
The child is Aeneas again;

Troy is in the nursery,
The rocking horse is on fire.

Child labor! The child must carry
His fathers on his back.

But seeing that so much is past
And that history has no ruth

For the individual,
Who drinks tea, who catches cold,

Let anger be general:
I hate an abstract thing.

        4

Brother and sister bounced
The bounding, unbroken ball,

The shattering sun fell down
Like swords upon their play,

Moving eastward among the stars
Toward February and October.

But the Maywind brushed their cheeks
Like a mother watching sleep,

And if for a moment they fight
Over the bouncing ball

And sister pinches brother
And brother kicks her shins,

Well! The heart of man in known:
It is a cactus bloom.

        5
 
The ground on which the ball bounces
Is another bouncing ball.

The wheeling, whirling world
Makes no will glad.

Spinning in its spotlight darkness,
It is too big for their hands.

A pitiless, purposeless Thing,
Arbitrary, and unspent,

Made for no play, for no children,
But chasing only itself.

The innocent are overtaken,
They are not innocent.

They are their father's fathers,
The past is inevitable.

        6
 
Now, in another October
Of this tragic star,

I see my second year,
I eat my baked potato.

It is my buttered world,
But, poked by my unlearned hand,

It falls from the highchair down
And I begin to howl

And I see the ball roll under
The iron gate which is locked.

Sister is screaming, brother is howling,
The ball has evaded their will.

Even a bouncing ball
Is uncontrollable,

And is under the garden wall.
I am overtaken by terror

Thinking of my father's fathers,
And of my own will.",Ballad
81,Percy Bysshe Shelley,The Devil's Walk.  A Ballad,"I.
Once, early in the morning, Beelzebub arose,
With care his sweet person adorning,
He put on his Sunday clothes.

II.
He drew on a boot to hide his hoof, 
He drew on a glove to hide his claw,
His horns were concealed by a Bras Chapeau,
And the Devil went forth as natty a Beau
As Bond-street ever saw.

III.
He sate him down, in London town, 
Before earth's morning ray;
With a favourite imp he began to chat,
On religion, and scandal, this and that,
Until the dawn of day.

IV.
And then to St. James's Court he went, 
And St. Paul‚Äôs Church he took on his way;
He was mighty thick with every Saint,
Though they were formal and he was gay.

V.
The Devil was an agriculturist,
And as bad weeds quickly grow, 
In looking over his farm, I wist,
He wouldn't find cause for woe.

VI.
He peeped in each hole, to each chamber stole,
His promising live-stock to view;
Grinning applause, he just showed them his claws, 
And they shrunk with affright from his ugly sight,
Whose work they delighted to do.

VII.
Satan poked his red nose into crannies so small
One would think that the innocents fair,
Poor lambkins! were just doing nothing at all 
But settling some dress or arranging some ball,
But the Devil saw deeper there.

VIII.
A Priest, at whose elbow the Devil during prayer
Sate familiarly, side by side,
Declared that, if the Tempter were there, 
His presence he would not abide.
Ah! ah! thought Old Nick, that's a very stale trick,
For without the Devil, O favourite of Evil,
In your carriage you would not ride.

IX.
Satan next saw a brainless King,
Whose house was as hot as his own;
Many Imps in attendance were there on the wing,
They flapped the pennon and twisted the sting,
Close by the very Throne.

X.
Ah! ah! thought Satan, the pasture is good,
My Cattle will here thrive better than others;
They dine on news of human blood,
They sup on the groans of the dying and dead,
And supperless never will go to bed;
Which will make them fat as their brothers. 

XI.
Fat as the Fiends that feed on blood,
Fresh and warm from the fields of Spain,
Where Ruin ploughs her gory way,
Where the shoots of earth are nipped in the bud,
Where Hell is the Victor's prey, 
Its glory the meed of the slain.

XII.
Fat--as the Death-birds on Erin's shore,
That glutted themselves in her dearest gore,
And flitted round Castlereagh,
When they snatched the Patriot's heart, that HIS grasp 
Had torn from its widow's maniac clasp,
--And fled at the dawn of day.

XIII.
Fat--as the Reptiles of the tomb,
That riot in corruption's spoil,
That fret their little hour in gloom, 
And creep, and live the while.

XIV.
Fat as that Prince's maudlin brain,
Which, addled by some gilded toy,
Tired, gives his sweetmeat, and again
Cries for it, like a humoured boy. 

XV.
For he is fat,--his waistcoat gay,
When strained upon a levee day,
Scarce meets across his princely paunch;
And pantaloons are like half-moons
Upon each brawny haunch. 

XVI.
How vast his stock of calf! when plenty
Had filled his empty head and heart,
Enough to satiate foplings twenty,
Could make his pantaloon seams start.

XVII.
The Devil (who sometimes is called Nature), 
For men of power provides thus well,
Whilst every change and every feature,
Their great original can tell.

XVIII.
Satan saw a lawyer a viper slay,
That crawled up the leg of his table,
It reminded him most marvellously
Of the story of Cain and Abel.

IXX.
The wealthy yeoman, as he wanders
His fertile fields among,
And on his thriving cattle ponders,
Counts his sure gains, and hums a song;
Thus did the Devil, through earth walking,
Hum low a hellish song.

XX.
For they thrive well whose garb of gore
Is Satan‚Äôs choicest livery, 
And they thrive well who from the poor
Have snatched the bread of penury,
And heap the houseless wanderer‚Äôs store
On the rank pile of luxury.

XXI.
The Bishops thrive, though they are big; 
The Lawyers thrive, though they are thin;
For every gown, and every wig,
Hides the safe thrift of Hell within.

XXII.
Thus pigs were never counted clean,
Although they dine on finest corn; 
And cormorants are sin-like lean,
Although they eat from night to morn.

XXIII.
Oh! why is the Father of Hell in such glee,
As he grins from ear to ear?
Why does he doff his clothes joyfully,
As he skips, and prances, and flaps his wing,
As he sidles, leers, and twirls his sting,
And dares, as he is, to appear?

XXIV.
A statesman passed--alone to him,
The Devil dare his whole shape uncover, 
To show each feature, every limb,
Secure of an unchanging lover.

XXV.
At this known sign, a welcome sight,
The watchful demons sought their King,
And every Fiend of the Stygian night, 
Was in an instant on the wing.

XXVI.
Pale Loyalty, his guilt-steeled brow,
With wreaths of gory laurel crowned:
The hell-hounds, Murder, Want and Woe,
Forever hungering, flocked around; 
From Spain had Satan sought their food,
'Twas human woe and human blood!

XXVII.
Hark! the earthquake's crash I hear,--
Kings turn pale, and Conquerors start,
Ruffians tremble in their fear,
For their Satan doth depart.

XXVIII.
This day Fiends give to revelry
To celebrate their King's return,
And with delight its Sire to see
Hell's adamantine limits burn. 

XXIX.
But were the Devil's sight as keen
As Reason's penetrating eye,
His sulphurous Majesty I ween,
Would find but little cause for joy.

XXX.
For the sons of Reason see 
That, ere fate consume the Pole,
The false Tyrant's cheek shall be
Bloodless as his coward soul.",Ballad
82,Eugene Field,The Delectable Ballad Of The Waller Lot,"Up yonder in Buena Park
There is a famous spot,
In legend and in history
Yclept the Waller Lot.

There children play in daytime
And lovers stroll by dark,
For 't is the goodliest trysting-place
In all Buena Park.

Once on a time that beauteous maid,
Sweet little Sissy Knott,
Took out her pretty doll to walk
Within the Waller Lot.

While thus she fared, from Ravenswood
Came Injuns o'er the plain,
And seized upon that beauteous maid
And rent her doll in twain.

Oh, 't was a piteous thing to hear
Her lamentations wild;
She tore her golden curls and cried:
""My child! My child! My child!""

Alas, what cared those Injun chiefs
How bitterly wailed she?
They never had been mothers,
And they could not hope to be!

""Have done with tears,"" they rudely quoth,
And then they bound her hands;
For they proposed to take her off
To distant border lands.

But, joy! from Mr. Eddy's barn
Doth Willie Clow behold
The sight that makes his hair rise up
And all his blood run cold.

He put his fingers in his mouth
And whistled long and clear,
And presently a goodly horde
Of cow-boys did appear.

Cried Willie Clow: ""My comrades bold,
Haste to the Waller Lot,
And rescue from that Injun band
Our charming Sissy Knott!""

""Spare neither Injun buck nor squaw,
But smite them hide and hair!
Spare neither sex nor age nor size,
And no condition spare!""

Then sped that cow-boy band away,
Full of revengeful wrath,
And Kendall Evans rode ahead
Upon a hickory lath.

And next came gallant Dady Field
And Willie's brother Kent,
The Eddy boys and Robbie James,
On murderous purpose bent.

For they were much beholden to
That maid - in sooth, the lot
Were very, very much in love
With charming Sissy Knott.

What wonder? She was beauty's queen,
And good beyond compare;
Moreover, it was known she was
Her wealthy father's heir!

Now when the Injuns saw that band
They trembled with affright,
And yet they thought the cheapest thing
To do was stay and fight.

So sturdily they stood their ground,
Nor would their prisoner yield,
Despite the wrath of Willie Clow
And gallant Dady Field.

Oh, never fiercer battle raged
Upon the Waller Lot,
And never blood more freely flowed
Than flowed for Sissy Knott!

An Injun chief of monstrous size
Got Kendall Evans down,
And Robbie James was soon o'erthrown
By one of great renown.

And Dady Field was sorely done,
And Willie Clow was hurt,
And all that gallant cow-boy band
Lay wallowing in the dirt.

But still they strove with might and main
Till all the Waller Lot
Was strewn with hair and gouts of gore -
All, all for Sissy Knott!

Then cried the maiden in despair:
""Alas, I sadly fear
The battle and my hopes are lost,
Unless some help appear!""

Lo, as she spoke, she saw afar
The rescuer looming up -
The pride of all Buena Park,
Clow's famous yellow pup!

""Now, sick'em, Don,"" the maiden cried,
""Now, sick'em, Don!"" cried she;
Obedient Don at once complied -
As ordered, so did he.

He sicked'em all so passing well
That, overcome by fright,
The Indian horde gave up the fray
And safety sought in flight.

They ran and ran and ran and ran
O'er valley, plain, and hill;
And if they are not walking now,
Why, then, they're running still.

The cow-boys rose up from the dust
With faces black and blue;
""Remember, beauteous maid,"" said they,
""We've bled and died for you!""

""And though we suffer grievously,
We gladly hail the lot
That brings us toils and pains and wounds
For charming Sissy Knott!""

But Sissy Knott still wailed and wept,
And still her fate reviled;
For who could patch her dolly up -
Who, who could mend her child?

Then out her doting mother came,
And soothed her daughter then;
""Grieve not, my darling, I will sew
Your dolly up again!""

Joy soon succeeded unto grief,
And tears were soon dried up,
And dignities were heaped upon
Clow's noble yellow pup.

Him all that goodly company
Did as deliverer hail -
They tied a ribbon round his neck,
Another round his tail.

And every anniversary day
Upon the Waller Lot
They celebrate the victory won
For charming Sissy Knott.

And I, the poet of these folk,
Am ordered to compile
This truly famous history
In good old ballad style.

Which having done as to have earned
The sweet rewards of fame,
In what same style I did begin
I now shall end the same.

So let us sing: Long live the King,
Long live the Queen and Jack,
Long live the ten-spot and the ace,
And also all the pack.",Ballad
83,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,The Ballad Of The Dark Ladie.  A Fragment.,"Beneath yon birch with silver bark,
And boughs so pendulous and fair,
The brook falls scatter'd down the rock:
And all is mossy there!

And there upon the moss she sits,
The Dark Ladie in silent pain;
The heavy tear is in her eye,
And drops and swells again.

Three times she sends her little page
Up the castled mountain's breast,
If he might find the Knight that wears
The Griffin for his crest.

The sun was sloping down the sky,
And she had linger'd there all day,
Counting moments, dreaming fears--
Oh wherefore can he stay?

She hears a rustling o'er the brook,
She sees far off a swinging bough!
''Tis He! 'Tis my betrothed Knight!
Lord Falkland, it is Thou!'

She springs, she clasps him round the neck,
She sobs a thousand hopes and fears,
Her kisses glowing on his cheeks
She quenches with her tears.

'My friends with rude ungentle words
They scoff and bid me fly to thee!
O give me shelter in thy breast!
O shield and shelter me!

'My Henry, I have given thee much,
I gave what I can ne'er recall,
I gave my heart, I gave my peace,
O Heaven! I gave thee all.'

The Knight made answer to the Maid,
While to his heart he held her hand,
'Nine castles hath my noble sire,
None statelier in the land.

'The fairest one shall be my love's,
The fairest castle of the nine!
Wait only till the stars peep out,
The fairest shall be thine:

'Wait only till the hand of eve
Hath wholly closed yon western bars,
And through the dark we two will steal
Beneath the twinkling stars!'--

'The dark? the dark? No! not the dark?
The twinkling stars? How, Henry? How?
O God! 'twas in the eye of noon
He pledged his sacred vow!

'And in the eye of noon my love
Shall lead me from my mother's door,
Sweet boys and girls all clothed in white
Strewing flowers before:

'But first the nodding minstrels go
With music meet for lordly bowers,
The children next in snow-white vests,
Strewing buds and flowers!

'And then my love and I shall pace,
My jet black hair in pearly braids,
Between our comely bachelors
And blushing bridal maids.'

84,Thomas Babbington Macaulay,An Election Ballad,"As I sate down to breakfast in state, 
At my living of Tithing-cum-Boring, 
With Betty beside me to wait, 
Came a rap that almost beat the door in. 
I laid down my basin of tea, 
And Betty ceased spreading the toast, 
""As sure as a gun, sir,"" said she, 
""That must be the knock of the post."" 

A letter--and free--bring it here-- 
I have no correspondent who franks. 
No! Yes! Can it be? Why, my dear, 
'Tis our glorious, our Protestant Bankes. 
""Dear sir, as I know you desire 
That the Church should receive due protection, 
I humbly presume to require 
Your aid at the Cambridge election. 

""It has lately been brought to my knowledge, 
That the Ministers fully design 
To suppress each cathedral and college, 
And eject every learned divine. 
To assist this detestable scheme 
Three nuncios from Rome are come over; 
They left Calais on Monday by steam, 
And landed to dinner at Dover. 

""An army of grim Cordeliers, 
Well furnished with relics and vermin, 
Will follow, Lord Westmoreland fears, 
To effect what their chiefs may determine. 
Lollard's bower, good authorities say, 
Is again fitting up for a prison; 
And a wood-merchant told me to-day 
'Tis a wonder how faggots have risen. 

""The finance scheme of Canning contains 
A new Easter-offering tax; 
And he means to devote all the gains 
To a bounty on thumb-screws and racks. 
Your living, so neat and compact-- 
Pray, don't let the news give you pain!-- 
Is promised, I know for a fact, 
To an olive-faced Padre from Spain."" 

I read, and I felt my heart bleed, 
Sore wounded with horror and pity; 
So I flew, with all possible speed, 
To our Protestant champion's committee. 
True gentlemen, kind and well-bred! 
No fleering! no distance! no scorn! 
They asked after my wife who is dead, 
And my children who never were born. 

They then, like high-principled Tories, 
Called our Sovereign unjust and unsteady, 
And assailed him with scandalous stories, 
Till the coach for the voters was ready. 
That coach might be well called a casket 
Of learning and brotherly love: 
There were parsons in boot and in basket; 
There were parsons below and above. 

There were Sneaker and Griper, a pair 
Who stick to Lord Mulesby like leeches; 
A smug chaplain of plausible air, 
Who writes my Lord Goslingham's speeches. 
Dr Buzz, who alone is a host, 
Who, with arguments weighty as lead, 
Proves six times a week in the Post 
That flesh somehow differs from bread. 

Dr Nimrod, whose orthodox toes 
Are seldom withdrawn from the stirrup; 
Dr Humdrum, whose eloquence flows, 
Like droppings of sweet poppy syrup; 
Dr Rosygill puffing and fanning, 
And wiping away perspiration; 
Dr Humbug who proved Mr Canning 
The beast in St John's Revelation. 

A layman can scarce form a notion 
Of our wonderful talk on the road; 
Of the learning, the wit, and devotion, 
Which almost each syllable showed: 
Why divided allegiance agrees 
So ill with our free constitution; 
How Catholics swear as they please, 
In hope of the priest's absolution; 

How the Bishop of Norwich had bartered 
His faith for a legate's commission; 
How Lyndhurst, afraid to be martyr'd, 
Had stooped to a base coalition; 
How Papists are cased from compassion 
By bigotry, stronger than steel; 
How burning would soon come in fashion, 
And how very bad it must feel. 

We were all so much touched and excited 
By a subject so direly sublime, 
That the rules of politeness were slighted, 
And we all of us talked at a time; 
And in tones, which each moment grew louder, 
Told how we should dress for the show, 
And where we should fasten the powder, 
And if we should bellow or no. 

Thus from subject to subject we ran, 
And the journey passed pleasantly o'er, 
Till at last Dr Humdrum began; 
From that time I remember no more. 
At Ware he commenced his prelection, 
In the dullest of clerical drones; 
And when next I regained recollection 
We were rambling o'er Trumpington stones.",Ballad
85,Yevgeny Yevtushenko,Ballad About False Beacons,"We‚Äôve been bewitched by countless lies, 
by azure images of ice, 
by false promises of open sky and sea, 
and rescued by a God we don‚Äôt believe.
Like coppers rattling from a beggar‚Äôs plate
guiding lights have fallen on our days
and burned and died.
We‚Äôve pressed our ship
a pilgrimage of nights toward such lights
as, always elusive, lured and tricked
the keel upon the rocks and ripped
the helmhold from the hand and lashed
the beggared palm to scraps.
Ice tightens at the bow and breath.
To dock, to dropp the anchor to its rest, 
to drift (a dream!)  on waters quieted
and calmed. We can‚Äôt. We‚Äôre after a mirage.
(The whiskered walrus brays; the sea salt thaws.
Again, we‚Äôre off!) 
Raised on powdered milk, we‚Äôll have no faith
in beacons any longer, nor mistake
real for fake, or waking for a dream.
Beacons can‚Äôt be trusted. Trust instead
the will of your own hand and head.
Again the captain waves his glass, 
sights a beacon, turns and cries
'Helmsman! There‚Äôs a beacon. Are you blind? '
But Helmsman, with the truer eye
thinks mutiny and grumbles, 
 'A mirage.'",Ballad
86,George Gordon Byron,A Very Mournful Ballad On The Siege And ..,"Which, in the Arabic language, is to the following purport:

I
THE Moorish King rides up and down,
Through Granada's royal town;
From Elvira's gate to those
Of Bivarambla on he goes.
Woe is me, Alhama!

II
Letters to the monarch tell 
How Alhama's city fell: 
In the fire the scroll he threw, 
And the messenger he slew.
Woe is me, Albamal

III
He quits his mule, and mounts his horse, 
And through the street directs his course; 
Through the street of Zacatin 
To the Alhambra spurring in.
Woe is me, Alhama!

IV
When the Alhambra walls he gain'd, 
On the moment he ordain'd
That the trumpet straight should sound 
With the silver clarion round.
Woe is me, Alhamal

V
And when the hollow drums of war 
Beat the loud alarm afar, 
That the Moors of town and plain 
Might answer to the martial strain.
Woe is me, Alhama!

VI
Then the Moors, by this aware, 
That bloody Mars recall'd them there, 
One by one, and two by two, 
To a mighty squadron grew.
Woe is me, Alhama!

VII
Out then spake an aged Moor 
In these words the king before, 
'Wherefore call on us, oh King? 
What may mean this gathering?'
Woe is me, Alhama!

VIII
'Friends! ye have, alas! to know 
Of a most disastrous blow; 
That the Christians, stern and bold, 
Have obtain'd Albania's hold.'
Woe is me, Alhama!

IX
Out then spake old Alfaqui, 
With his beard so white to see, 
'Good King! thou art justly served, 
Good King! this thou hast deserved.
Woe is me, Alhama!

X
'By thee were slain, in evil hour, 
The Abencerrage, Granada's flower; 
And strangers were received by thee 
Of Cordova the Chivalry.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XI
'And for this, oh King! is sent 
On thee a double chastisement: 
Thee and thine, thy crown and realm, 
One last wreck shall overwhelm.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XII
'He who holds no laws in awe, 
He must perish by the law; 
And Granada must be won, 
And thyself with her undone.'
Woe is me, Alhama!

XIII
Fire Crashed from out the old Moor's eyes, 
The Monarch's wrath began to rise, 
Because he answer'd, and because 
He spake exceeding well of laws.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XIV
'There is no law to say such things 
As may disgust the ear of kings:
'Thus, snorting with his choler, said 
The Moorish King, and doom'd him dead.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XV
Moor Alfaqui! Moor Alfaqui! 
Though thy beard so hoary be, 
The King hath sent to have thee seized, 
For Alhama's loss displeased.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XVI
And to fix thy head upon 
High Alhambra's loftiest stone; 
That thus for thee should be the law, 
And others tremble when they saw.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XVII
'Cavalier, and man of worth! 
Let these words of mine go forth! 
Let the Moorish Monarch know,
That to him I nothing owe.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XVIII
'But on my soul Alhama weighs, 
And on my inmost spirit preys;
And if the King his land hath lost, 
Yet others may have lost the most.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XIX
'Sires have lost their children, wives 
Their lords, and valiant men their lives! 
One what best his love might claim 
Hath lost, another wealth, or fame.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XX
'I lost a damsel in that hour, 
Of all the land the loveliest flower; 
Doubloons a hundred I would pay, 
And think her ransom cheap that day.'
Woe is me, Alhama!

XXI
And as these things the old Moor said, 
They sever'd from the trunk his head; 
And to the Alhambra's wall with speed 
'Twas carried, as the King decreed.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XXII
And men and infants therein weep 
Their loss, so heavy and so deep; 
Granada's ladies, all she rears 
Within her walls, burst into tears.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XXIII
And from the windows o'er the walls 
The sable web of mourning falls; 
The King weeps as a woman o'er 
His loss, for it is much and sore.
Woe is me, Alhama!",Ballad

And oh the day is fair.
The sky is dear and blue,
The flowers are rich of hue,
The air I breathe is rare,
I have no grief or care;
For my own love is true,
And oh the day is fair.
My love is false I find,
And oh the day is dark.
Blows sadly down the wind,
While sorrow holds my mind;
I do not hear the lark,
For quenched is life's dear spark,‚Äî
My love is false I find,
And oh the day is dark!
For love doth make the day
Or dark or doubly bright;
Her beams along the way
Dispel the gloom and gray. 
She lives and all is bright,
She dies and life is night.
For love doth make the day,
Or dark or doubly bright.",Ballad
90,Robert Southey,Mary - A Ballad,"I.

Who is she, the poor Maniac, whose wildly-fix'd eyes
 Seem a heart overcharged to express?
She weeps not, yet often and deeply she sighs,
She never complains, but her silence implies
 The composure of settled distress.


II.

No aid, no compassion the Maniac will seek,
 Cold and hunger awake not her care:
Thro' her rags do the winds of the winter blow bleak
On her poor withered bosom half bare, and her cheek
 Has the deathy pale hue of despair.


III.

Yet chearful and happy, nor distant the day,
 Poor Mary the Maniac has been;
The Traveller remembers who journeyed this way
No damsel so lovely, no damsel so gay
 As Mary the Maid of the Inn.


IV.

Her chearful address fill'd the guests with delight
 As she welcomed them in with a smile:
Her heart was a stranger to childish affright,
And Mary would walk by the Abbey at night
 When the wind whistled down the dark aisle.


V.

She loved, and young Richard had settled the day,
 And she hoped to be happy for life;
But Richard was idle and worthless, and they
Who knew him would pity poor Mary and say
 That she was too good for his wife.


VI.

'Twas in autumn, and stormy and dark was the night,
 And fast were the windows and door;
Two guests sat enjoying the fire that burnt bright,
And smoking in silence with tranquil delight
 They listen'd to hear the wind roar.


VII.

""Tis pleasant,"" cried one, ""seated by the fire side
 ""To hear the wind whistle without.""
""A fine night for the Abbey!"" his comrade replied,
""Methinks a man's courage would now be well tried
 ""Who should wander the ruins about.


VIII.

""I myself, like a school-boy, should tremble to hear
 ""The hoarse ivy shake over my head;
""And could fancy I saw, half persuaded by fear,
""Some ugly old Abbot's white spirit appear,
 ""For this wind might awaken the dead!""


IX.

""I'll wager a dinner,"" the other one cried,
 ""That Mary would venture there now.""
""Then wager and lose!"" with a sneer he replied,
""I'll warrant she'd fancy a ghost by her side,
 ""And faint if she saw a white cow.""


X.

""Will Mary this charge on her courage allow?""
 His companion exclaim'd with a smile;
""I shall win, for I know she will venture there now,
""And earn a new bonnet by bringing a bough
 ""From the elder that grows in the aisle.""


XI.

With fearless good humour did Mary comply,
 And her way to the Abbey she bent;
The night it was dark, and the wind it was high
And as hollowly howling it swept thro' the sky
 She shiver'd with cold as she went.


XII.

O'er the path so well known still proceeded the Maid
 Where the Abbey rose dim on the sight,
Thro' the gate-way she entered, she felt not afraid
Yet the ruins were lonely and wild, and their shade
 Seem'd to deepen the gloom of the night.


XIII.

All around her was silent, save when the rude blast
 Howl'd dismally round the old pile;
Over weed-cover'd fragments still fearless she past,
And arrived in the innermost ruin at last
 Where the elder tree grew in the aisle.


XIV.

Well-pleas'd did she reach it, and quickly drew near
 And hastily gather'd the bough:
When the sound of a voice seem'd to rise on her ear,
She paus'd, and she listen'd, all eager to hear,
 Aud her heart panted fearfully now.


XV.

The wind blew, the hoarse ivy shook over her head,
 She listen'd,--nought else could she hear.
The wind ceas'd, her heart sunk in her bosom with dread
For she heard in the ruins distinctly the tread
 Of footsteps approaching her near.


XVI.

Behind a wide column half breathless with fear
 She crept to conceal herself there:
That instant the moon o'er a dark cloud shone clear,
And she saw in the moon-light two ruffians appear
 And between them a corpse did they bear.


XVII.

Then Mary could feel her heart-blood curdle cold!
 Again the rough wind hurried by,--
It blew off the hat of the one, and behold
Even close to the feet of poor Mary it roll'd,--
 She felt, and expected to die.


XVIII.

""Curse the hat!"" he exclaims. ""Nay come on and first hide
 ""The dead body,"" his comrade replies.
She beheld them in safety pass on by her side,
She seizes the hat, fear her courage supplied,
 And fast thro' the Abbey she flies.


XIX.

She ran with wild speed, she rush'd in at the door,
 She gazed horribly eager around,
Then her limbs could support their faint burthen no more,
And exhausted and breathless she sunk on the floor
 Unable to utter a sound.


XX.

Ere yet her pale lips could the story impart,
 For a moment the hat met her view;--
Her eyes from that object convulsively start,
For--oh God what cold horror then thrill'd thro' her heart,
 When the name of her Richard she knew!


XXI.

Where the old Abbey stands, on the common hard by
 His gibbet is now to be seen.
Not far from the road it engages the eye,
The Traveller beholds it, and thinks with a sigh
 Of poor Mary the Maid of the Inn.",Ballad
91,Gilbert Keith Chesterton,The Ballad Of The Anti-Puritan,"They spoke of Progress spiring round, 
         Of light and Mrs Humphrey Ward-- 
         It is not true to say I frowned, 
         Or ran about the room and roared; 
         I might have simply sat and snored-- 
         I rose politely in the club 
         And said, `I feel a little bored; 
         Will someone take me to a pub?' 

         The new world's wisest did surround

92,Robert William Service,The Ballad Of Blasphemous Bill,"I took a contract to bury the body of blasphemous Bill MacKie,
Whenever, wherever or whatsoever the manner of death he die--
Whether he die in the light o' day or under the peak-faced moon;
In cabin or dance-hall, camp or dive, mucklucks or patent shoon;
On velvet tundra or virgin peak, by glacier, drift or draw;
In muskeg hollow or canyon gloom, by avalanche, fang or claw;
By battle, murder or sudden wealth, by pestilence, hooch or lead--
I swore on the Book I would follow and look till I found my tombless dead.

For Bill was a dainty kind of cuss, and his mind was mighty sot
On a dinky patch with flowers and grass in a civilized bone-yard lot.
And where he died or how he died, it didn't matter a damn
So long as he had a grave with frills and a tombstone ""epigram"".
So I promised him, and he paid the price in good cheechako coin
(Which the same I blowed in that very night down in the Tenderloin).
Then I painted a three-foot slab of pine: ""Here lies poor Bill MacKie"",
And I hung it up on my cabin wall and I waited for Bill to die.

Years passed away, and at last one day came a squaw with a story strange,
Of a long-deserted line of traps 'way back of the Bighorn range;
Of a little hut by the great divide, and a white man stiff and still,
Lying there by his lonesome self, and I figured it must be Bill.
So I thought of the contract I'd made with him, and I took down from the shelf
The swell black box with the silver plate he'd picked out for hisself;
And I packed it full of grub and ""hooch"", and I slung it on the sleigh;
Then I harnessed up my team of dogs and was off at dawn of day.

You know what it's like in the Yukon wild when it's sixty-nine below;
When the ice-worms wriggle their purple heads through the crust of the pale blue snow;
When the pine-trees crack like little guns in the silence of the wood,
And the icicles hang down like tusks under the parka hood;
When the stove-pipe smoke breaks sudden off, and the sky is weirdly lit,
And the careless feel of a bit of steel burns like a red-hot spit;
When the mercury is a frozen ball, and the frost-fiend stalks to kill--
Well, it was just like that that day when I set out to look for Bill.

Oh, the awful hush that seemed to crush me down on every hand,
As I blundered blind with a trail to find through that blank and bitter land;
Half dazed, half crazed in the winter wild, with its grim heart-breaking woes,
And the ruthless strife for a grip on life that only the sourdough knows!
North by the compass, North I pressed; river and peak and plain
Passed like a dream I slept to lose and I waked to dream again.

River and plain and mighty peak--and who could stand unawed?
As their summits blazed, he could stand undazed at the foot of the throne of God.
North, aye, North, through a land accurst, shunned by the scouring brutes,
And all I heard was my own harsh word and the whine of the malamutes,
Till at last I came to a cabin squat, built in the side of a hill,
And I burst in the door, and there on the floor, frozen to death, lay Bill.

Ice, white ice, like a winding-sheet, sheathing each smoke-grimed wall;
Ice on the stove-pipe, ice on the bed, ice gleaming over all;
Sparkling ice on the dead man's chest, glittering ice in his hair,
Ice on his fingers, ice in his heart, ice in his glassy stare;
Hard as a log and trussed like a frog, with his arms and legs outspread.
I gazed at the coffin I'd brought for him, and I gazed at the gruesome dead,
And at last I spoke: ""Bill liked his joke; but still, goldarn his eyes,
A man had ought to consider his mates in the way he goes and dies.""

Have you ever stood in an Arctic hut in the shadow of the Pole,
With a little coffin six by three and a grief you can't control?
Have you ever sat by a frozen corpse that looks at you with a grin,
And that seems to say: ""You may try all day, but you'll never jam me in""?
I'm not a man of the quitting kind, but I never felt so blue
As I sat there gazing at that stiff and studying what I'd do.
Then I rose and I kicked off the husky dogs that were nosing round about,
And I lit a roaring fire in the stove, and I started to thaw Bill out.

Well, I thawed and thawed for thirteen days, but it didn't seem no good;
His arms and legs stuck out like pegs, as if they was made of wood.
Till at last I said: ""It ain't no use--he's froze too hard to thaw;
He's obstinate, and he won't lie straight, so I guess I got to--saw.""
So I sawed off poor Bill's arms and legs, and I laid him snug and straight
In the little coffin he picked hisself, with the dinky silver plate;
And I came nigh near to shedding a tear as I nailed him safely down;
Then I stowed him away in my Yukon sleigh, and I started back to town.

So I buried him as the contract was in a narrow grave and deep,
And there he's waiting the Great Clean-up, when the Judgment sluice-heads sweep;
And I smoke my pipe and I meditate in the light of the Midnight Sun,
And sometimes I wonder if they was, the awful things I done.
And as I sit and the parson talks, expounding of the Law,
I often think of poor old Bill--and how hard he was to saw.",Ballad

Wouldst thou with me to church repair,
Ere yet I feel the stroke of death.

""For trust me, love, I shall my life
With something like to joy resign,
If I but once may call thee wife,
And, dying, claim and hail thee mine.""

He ceased: and Lucy checked the thought
That he might at the altar die,....
The prayer with such true love was fraught,
How could she such a prayer deny?

They reached the church....her cheek was wan
With chilling fears of coming woe....
But triumph when the rites began
Lent Henry's cheek a flattering glow.

The nuptial knot was scarcely tied,
When Henry's eye strange lustre fired,
""She's mine! she's mine!"" he faltering cried,
And in that throb of joy expired.",Ballad
94,Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson,Ballad Of Tailor Nils,"If you were born before yesterday,
Surely you've heard about Tailor Nils, who flaunts him so gay.

If it's more than a week that you've been here,
Surely you've heard how Knut Storedragen got a lesson severe.

Up on the barn of Ola-Per Kviste after a punchin':
""When Nils heaves you again, take with you some luncheon.""

Hans Bugge, he was a man so renowned,
Haunting ghosts of his name spread alarm all around.

""Tailor Nils, where you wish to lie, now declare!
On that spot will I spit and lay your head right there.""--

""Oh, just come up so near, that I know you by the scent!
Think not that by your jaw to earth I shall be bent!""

When first they met, 't was scarce a bout at all,
Neither man was ready yet to try to get a fall.

The second time Hans Bugge slipped his hold.
""Are you tired now, Hans Bugge?  The dance will soon be bold.""

The third time Hans fell headlong, and forth the blood did spurt.
""Why spit you now so much, man?"" -- ""Oh my, that fall did hurt!""--

Saw you a tree casting shadows on new-fallen snow?
Saw you Nils on a maiden smiling glances bestow?

Have you seen Tailor Nils when the dance he commences?
Are you a maiden, then go!--It's too late, when you've lost your senses.",Ballad
95,Robert Southey,Rudiger - A Ballad,"Bright on the mountain's heathy slope
 The day's last splendors shine
And rich with many a radiant hue
 Gleam gayly on the Rhine.

And many a one from Waldhurst's walls
 Along the river stroll'd,
As ruffling o'er the pleasant stream
 The evening gales came cold.

So as they stray'd a swan they saw
 Sail stately up and strong,
And by a silver chain she drew
 A little boat along,

Whose streamer to the gentle breeze
 Long floating fluttered light,
Beneath whose crimson canopy
 There lay reclin'd a knight.

With arching crest and swelling breast
 On sail'd the stately swan
And lightly up the parting tide
 The little boat came on.

And onward to the shore they drew
 And leapt to land the knight,
And down the stream the swan-drawn boat
 Fell soon beyond the sight.

Was never a Maid in Waldhurst's walls
 Might match with Margaret,
Her cheek was fair, her eyes were dark,
 Her silken locks like jet.

And many a rich and noble youth
 Had strove to win the fair,
But never a rich or noble youth
 Could rival Rudiger.

At every tilt and turney he
 Still bore away the prize,
For knightly feats superior still
 And knightly courtesies.

His gallant feats, his looks, his love,
 Soon won the willing fair,
And soon did Margaret become
 The wife of Rudiger.

Like morning dreams of happiness
 Fast roll'd the months away,
For he was kind and she was kind
 And who so blest as they?

Yet Rudiger would sometimes sit
 Absorb'd in silent thought
And his dark downward eye would seem
 With anxious meaning fraught;

But soon he rais'd his looks again
 And smil'd his cares eway,
And mid the hall of gaiety
 Was none like him so gay.

And onward roll'd the waining months,
 The hour appointed came,
And Margaret her Rudiger
 Hail'd with a father's name.

But silently did Rudiger
 The little infant see,
And darkly on the babe he gaz'd
 And very sad was he.

And when to bless the little babe
 The holy Father came,
To cleanse the stains of sin away
 In Christ's redeeming name,

Then did the cheek of Rudiger
 Assume a death-pale hue,
And on his clammy forehead stood
 The cold convulsive dew;

And faltering in his speech he bade
 The Priest the rites delay,
Till he could, to right health restor'd,
 Enjoy the festive day.

When o'er the many-tinted sky
 He saw the day decline,
He called upon his Margaret
 To walk beside the Rhine.

""And we will take the little babe,
 ""For soft the breeze that blows,
""And the wild murmurs of the stream
 ""Will lull him to repose.""

So forth together did they go,
 The evening breeze was mild,
And Rudiger upon his arm
 Did pillow the sweet child.

And many a one from Waldhurst's walls
 Along the banks did roam,
But soon the evening wind came cold,
 And all betook them home.

Yet Rudiger in silent mood
 Along the banks would roam,
Nor aught could Margaret prevail
 To turn his footsteps home.

""Oh turn thee--turn thee Rudiger,
 ""The rising mists behold,
""The evening wind is damp and chill,
 ""The little babe is cold!""

""Now hush thee--hush thee Margaret,
 ""The mists will do no harm,
""And from the wind the little babe
 ""Lies sheltered on my arm.""

""Oh turn thee--turn thee Rudiger,
 ""Why onward wilt thou roam?
""The moon is up, the night is cold,
 ""And we are far from home.""

He answered not, for now he saw
 A Swan come sailing strong,
And by a silver chain she drew
 A little boat along.

To shore they came, and to the boat
 Fast leapt he with the child,
And in leapt Margaret--breathless now
 And pale with fear and wild.

With arching crest and swelling breast
 On sail'd the stately swan,
And lightly down the rapid tide
 The little boat went on.

The full-orb'd moon that beam'd around
 Pale splendor thro' the night,
Cast through the crimson canopy
 A dim-discoloured light.

And swiftly down the hurrying stream
 In silence still they sail,
And the long streamer fluttering fast
 Flapp'd to the heavy gale.

And he was mute in sullen thought
 And she was mute with fear,
Nor sound but of the parting tide
 Broke on the listening ear.

The little babe began to cry
 And waked his mother's care,
""Now give to me the little babe
 ""For God's sake, Rudiger!""

""Now hush thee, hush thee Margaret!
 ""Nor my poor heart distress--
""I do but pay perforce the price
 ""Of former happiness.

""And hush thee too my little babe,
 ""Thy cries so feeble cease:
""Lie still, lie still;--a little while
 ""And thou shalt be at peace.""

So as he spake to land they drew,
 And swift he stept on shore,
And him behind did Margaret
 Close follow evermore.

It was a place all desolate,
 Nor house nor tree was there,
And there a rocky mountain rose
 Barren, and bleak, and bare.

And at its base a cavern yawn'd,
 No eye its depth might view,
For in the moon-beam shining round
 That darkness darker grew.

Cold Horror crept thro' Margaret's blood,
 Her heart it paus'd with fear,
When Rudiger approach'd the cave
 And cried, ""lo I am here!""

A deep sepulchral sound the cave
 Return'd ""lo I am here!""
And black from out the cavern gloom
 Two giant arms appear.

And Rudiger approach'd and held
 The little infant nigh;
Then Margaret shriek'd, and gather'd then
 New powers from agony.

And round the baby fast and firm
 Her trembling arms she folds,
And with a strong convulsive grasp
 The little infant holds.

""Now help me, Jesus!"" loud she cries.
 And loud on God she calls;
Then from the grasp of Rudiger
 The little infant falls.

And now he shriek'd, for now his frame
 The huge black arms clasp'd round,
And dragg'd the wretched Rudiger
 Adown the dark profound.",Ballad

Ye summoned our kynge. Why dyde ye so?
To you no thyng it dyde accorde
To sommom our kynge your soverayne lorde.
A kynge a sommer it is wonder; 
Knowe ye not salte and suger asonder?
In your somnynage ye were to malaperte,
and your harolde no thynge experte;
Ye thought ye dyde it full valyauntolye,
But not worth thre skyppes of a pye.
Syr squyer-galyarde ye were to swyfte;
Your wyll renne before your wytte.
To be so scornefull to your alye
Your conseyle was not worth a flye.
Before the Frensshe kynge, Danes and other
Ye ought to honour your lorde and brother.
Trowe ye, Syr James, his noble grace
For you and your Scottes wolde tourne his face?
Now ye proude Scottes of Gelawaye
For your kynge may synge welawaye.
Now must ye knowe our kynge for your regent,
Your soverayne lorde and presedent.

And ye be desolate as Armeleche.

97,William Makepeace Thackeray,The Ballad Of Bouillabaisse,"A street there is in Paris famous, 
For which no rhyme our language yields, 
Rue Neuve de petits Champs its name is -  
The New Street of the Little Fields; 
And there's an inn, not rich and splendid, 
But still in comfortable case; 
The which in youth I oft attended, 
To eat a bowl of Bouillabaisse. 

This Bouillabaisse a noble dish is -  
A sort of soup, or broth, or brew, 
Or hotchpotch of all sorts of fishes, 
That Greenwich never could outdo; 
Green herbs, red peppers, muscles, saffern, 
Soles, onions, garlic, roach, and dace; 
All these you eat at Terr√©'s tavern, 
In that one dish of Bouillabaisse. 

Indeed, a rich and savory stew 'tis; 
And true philosophers, methinks, 
Who love all sorts of natural beauties, 
Should love good victuals and good drinks. 
And Cordelier or Benedictine 
Might gladly, sure, his lot embrace, 
Nor find a fast-day too afflicting, 
Which served him up a Bouillabaisse. 

I wonder if the house still there is? 
Yes, here the lamp is as before; 
The smiling, red-cheek'd √©caill√®re is 
Still opening oysters at the door. 
Is Terr√© still alive and able? 
I recollect his droll grimace; 
He'd come and smile before your table, 
And hoped you like your Bouillabaisse. 

We enter; nothing's changed or older. 
'How's Monsieur Terr√©, waiter, pray? ' 
The waiter stares and shrugs his shoulder -  
'Monsieur is dead this many a day.' 
'It is the lot of saint and sinner. 
So honest Terr√©'s run his race! ' 
'What will Monsieur require for dinner? ' 
'Say, do you still cook Bouillabaisse? ' 

'Oh, oui, Monsieur,' 's the waiter's answer; 
'Quel vin Monsieur d√©sire-t-il? ' 
Tell me a good one.' 'That I can, sir; 
The Chambertin with yellow seal.' 
'So Terr√©'s gone,' I say, and sink in 
My old accustom'd corner-place; 
'He's done with feasting and with drinking, 
With Burgundy and Bouillabaisse.' 

My old accustom'd corner here is-  
The table still is in the nook; 
Ah! vanished many a busy year is, 
This well-known chair since last I took. 
When first I saw ye, cari luoghi, 
I'd scarce a beard upon my face, 
And now a grizzled, grim old fogy, 
I sit and wait for Bouillabaisse. 

Where are you, old companions trusty 
Of early days, here met to dine? 
Come, waiter! quick, a flagon crusty -  
I'll pledge them in the good old wine. 
The kind old voices and old faces 
My memory can quick retrace; 
Around the board they take their places, 
And share the wine and Bouillabaisse. 

There's Jack has made a wondrous marriage; 
There's laughing Tom is laughing yet; 
There's brave Augustus drives his carriage; 
There's poor old Fred in the Gazette; 
On James's head the grass is growing: 
Good Lord! the world has wagged apace 
Since here we sat the Claret flowing, 
And drank, and ate the Bouillabaisse. 

Ah me! how quick the days are flitting! 
I mind me of a time that's gone, 
When here I'd sit, as now I'm sitting, 
In this same place- but not alone. 
A fair young form was nestled near me, 
A dear, dear face looked fondly up, 
And sweetly spoke and smiled to cheer me. 
-  There's no one now to share my cup. 

........ 

I drink it as the Fates ordain it. 
Come, fill it, and have done with rhymes; 
Fill up the lonely glass, and drain it 
In memory of dear old times. 
Welcome the wine, whate'er the seal is; 
And sit you down and say your grace 
With thankful heart, whate'er the meal is. 
Here comes the smoking Bouillabaisse!",Ballad
98,William Shenstone,A Pastoral Ballad Iv: Disappointment,"Ye shepherds give ear to my lay, 
And take no more heed of my sheep: 
They have nothing to do but to stray; 
I have nothing to do but to weep. 
Yet do not my folly reprove; 
She was fair -- and my passion begun; 
She smil'd -- and I could not but love; 
She is faithless -- and I am undone. 
Perhaps I was void of all thought: 
Perhaps it was plain to foresee, 
That a nymph so compleat would be sought 
By a swain more engaging than me. 
Ah! love ev'ry hope can inspire; 
It banishes wisdom the while; 
And the lip of the nymph we admire 
Seems for ever adorn'd with a smile. 
She is faithless, and I am undone; 
Ye that witness the woes I endure; 
Let reason instruct you to shun 
What it cannot instruct you to cure. 
Beware how you loiter in vain 
Amid nymphs of an higher degree: 
It is not for me to explain 
How fair, and how fickle they be. 
Alas! from the day that we met, 
What hope of an end to my woes? 
When I cannot endure to forget 
The glance that undid my repose. 
Yet time may diminish the pain: 
The flow'r, and the shrub, and the tree,

Which I rear'd for her pleasure in vain, 
In time may have comfort for me. 
The sweets of a dew-sprinkled rose, 
The sound of a murmuring stream, 
The peace which from solitude flows, 
Henceforth shall be Corydon's theme. 
High transports are shewn to the sight, 
But we are not to find them our own; 
Fate never bestow'd such delight, 
As I with my Phyllis had known. 
O ye woods, spread your branches apace; 
To your deepest recesses I fly; 
I would hide with the beasts of the chace; 
I would vanish from every eye. 
Yet my reed shall resound thro' the grove 
With the same sad complaint it begun; 
How she smil'd, and I could not but love; 
Was faithless, and I am undone!",Ballad
99,Rudyard Kipling,"The Ballad Of The ""Clampherdown""","It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~
 Would sweep the Channel clean,
Wherefore she kept her hatches close
When the merry Channel chops arose,
 To save the bleached marine.
 
She had one bow-gun of a hundred ton,
 And a great stern-gun beside;
They dipped their noses deep in the sea,
They racked their stays and stanchions free
 In the wash of the wind-whipped tide.
 
It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~,
 Fell in with a cruiser light
That carried the dainty Hotchkiss gun
And a pair o' heels wherewith to run
 From the grip of a close-fought fight.
 
She opened fire at seven miles --
 As ye shoot at a bobbing cork --
And once she fired and twice she fired,
Till the bow-gun drooped like a lily tired
 That lolls upon the stalk.
 
""Captain, the bow-gun melts apace,
 The deck-beams break below,
'Twere well to rest for an hour or twain,
And botch the shattered plates again.""
 And he answered, ""Make it so.""
 
She opened fire within the mile --
 As ye shoot at the flying duck --
And the great stern-gun shot fair and true,
With the heave of the ship, to the stainless blue,
 And the great stern-turret stuck.
 
""Captain, the turret fills with steam,
 The feed-pipes burst below --
You can hear the hiss of the helpless ram,
You can hear the twisted runners jam.""
 And he answered, ""Turn and go!""
 
It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~,
 And grimly did she roll;
Swung round to take the cruiser's fire
As the White Whale faces the Thresher's ire
 When they war by the frozen Pole.
 
""Captain, the shells are falling fast,
 And faster still fall we;
And it is not meet for English stock
To bide in the heart of an eight-day clock
 The death they cannot see.""
 
""Lie down, lie down, my bold A.B.,
 We drift upon her beam;
We dare not ram, for she can run;
And dare ye fire another gun,
 And die in the peeling steam?""
 
It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~
 That carried an armour-belt;
But fifty feet at stern and bow
Lay bare as the paunch of the purser's sow,
 To the hail of the ~Nordenfeldt~.
 
""Captain, they hack us through and through;
 The chilled steel bolts are swift!
We have emptied the bunkers in open sea,
Their shrapnel bursts where our coal should be.""
 And he answered, ""Let her drift.""
 
It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~,
 Swung round upon the tide,
Her two dumb guns glared south and north,
And the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth,
 And she ground the cruiser's side.
 
""Captain, they cry, the fight is done,
 They bid you send your sword.""
And he answered, ""Grapple her stern and bow.
They have asked for the steel.  They shall have it now;
 Out cutlasses and board!""
 
It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~
 Spewed up four hundred men;
And the scalded stokers yelped delight,
As they rolled in the waist and heard the fight
 Stamp o'er their steel-walled pen.
 
They cleared the cruiser end to end,
 From conning-tower to hold.
They fought as they fought in Nelson's fleet;
They were stripped to the waist, they were bare to the feet,
 As it was in the days of old.
 
It was the sinking ~Clampherdown~
 Heaved up her battered side --
And carried a million pounds in steel,
To the cod and the corpse-fed conger-eel,
 And the scour of the Channel tide.
 
It was the crew of the ~Clampherdown~
 Stood out to sweep the sea,
On a cruiser won from an ancient foe,
As it was in the days of long ago,
 And as it still shall be.",Ballad
