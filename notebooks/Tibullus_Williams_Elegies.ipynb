       "      After his death, Ovid wrote him a fine elegy (p. 115); and\n",
       "      Domitius Marsus a neat epigram. The former promised him an\n",
       "      immortality equal to Homer's; the latter sent him to Elysium\n",
       "      at Virgil's side. These excessive eulogies are the more\n",
       "      remarkable in that Tibullus stood, proudly or indolently,\n",
       "      aloof from the court. He never flatters Augustus nor mentions\n",
       "      his name. He scoffs at riches, glory and war, wanting nothing\n",
       "      but to triumph as a lover. Ovid dares to group him with the\n",
       "      laurelled shades of Catullus and Gallus, of whom the former\n",
       "      had lampooned the divine Julius and the latter had been\n",

       "<p>\n",
       "      But in spite of this contemporary <i>succès\n",
       "      d'estime</i>, Tibullus is clearly a minor poet. He expresses\n",
       "      only one aspect of his time. His few themes are oft-repeated\n",
       "      and in monotonous rhythms. He sings of nothing greater than\n",
       "      his own lost loves. Yet of Delia, Nemesis and Neaera, we\n",
       "      learn only that all were fair, faithless and venal. For a man\n",
       "      whose ideal of love was life-long fidelity, he was tragically\n",

       "      If this were all, his verse would have perished with that of\n",

       "      private gentleman of the Augustan time, show a delicacy of\n",
       "      sentiment almost modern. Of the ribald curses which Catullus\n",
       "      hurls after his departing Lesbia, there is nothing. He throws\n",

       "      popular as a sort of Latin Rousseau. He satirized rank,\n",
       "      riches and glory as corrupting man's primitive simplicity. He\n",

       "      Greek learning, such as cumber Virgil and Horace, but with an\n",
       "      original passion. He cannot speak of the jewelled Roman\n",
