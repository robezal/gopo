0,William Shakespeare,"From fairest creatures we desire increase,
  That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
  But as the riper should by time decease,
  His tender heir might bear his memory:
  But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
  Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
  Making a famine where abundance lies,
  Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
  Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
  And only herald to the gaudy spring,
  Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
  And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
        Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
        To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.",Sonnet
1,William Shakespeare,"When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
  And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
  Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
  Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:
  Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
  Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
  To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,
  Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
  How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,
  If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
  Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'
  Proving his beauty by succession thine!
        This were to be new made when thou art old,
        And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.",Sonnet
2,William Shakespeare,"Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
  Now is the time that face should form another;
  Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
  Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
  For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
  Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
  Of his self-love to stop posterity?
  Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
  Calls back the lovely April of her prime;
  So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
        But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
        Die single and thine image dies with thee.",Sonnet
3,William Shakespeare,"Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
  Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
  Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,
  And being frank she lends to those are free:
  Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
  The bounteous largess given thee to give?
  Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
  So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
  For having traffic with thy self alone,
  Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:
  Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,
  What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
        Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
        Which, used, lives th' executor to be.",Sonnet
4,William Shakespeare,"Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
  The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
  Will play the tyrants to the very same
  And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
  For never-resting time leads summer on
  To hideous winter, and confounds him there;
  Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,
  Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:
  Then were not summer's distillation left,
  A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
  Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
  Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:
        But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,
        Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.",Sonnet
5,William Shakespeare,"Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,
  In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:
  Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
  With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd.
  That use is not forbidden usury,
  Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
  That's for thy self to breed another thee,
  Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;
  Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
  If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee:
  Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
  Leaving thee living in posterity?
        Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair
        To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.",Sonnet
6,William Shakespeare,"Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
  Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
  And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,
  Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
  Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
  Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
  But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,
  Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,
  The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
  From his low tract, and look another way:
        So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:
        Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son.",Sonnet
7,William Shakespeare,"Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
  Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
  Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
  If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
  By unions married, do offend thine ear,
  They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
  In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
  Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
  Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
  Resembling sire and child and happy mother,
  Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
        Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
        Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.'",Sonnet
8,William Shakespeare,"Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,
  That thou consum'st thy self in single life?
  Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
  The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;
  The world will be thy widow and still weep
  That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
  When every private widow well may keep
  By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:
  Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend
  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
  But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
  And kept unused the user so destroys it.
        No love toward others in that bosom sits
        That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.",Sonnet
9,William Shakespeare,"For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,
  Who for thy self art so unprovident.
  Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,
  But that thou none lov'st is most evident:
  For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate,
  That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,
  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
  Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
  O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:
  Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love?
  Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
  Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
        Make thee another self for love of me,
        That beauty still may live in thine or thee.",Sonnet
10,William Shakespeare,"As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,
  In one of thine, from that which thou departest;
  And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,
  Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,
  Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;
  Without this folly, age, and cold decay:
  If all were minded so, the times should cease
  And threescore year would make the world away.
  Let those whom nature hath not made for store,
  Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:
  Look, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more;
  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
        She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,
        Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.",Sonnet
11,William Shakespeare,"When I do count the clock that tells the time,
  And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
  When I behold the violet past prime,
  And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;
  When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
  And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,
  Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,
  Then of thy beauty do I question make,
  That thou among the wastes of time must go,
  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
  And die as fast as they see others grow;
        And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
        Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.",Sonnet
12,William Shakespeare,"O! that you were your self; but, love you are
  No longer yours, than you your self here live:
  Against this coming end you should prepare,
  And your sweet semblance to some other give:
  So should that beauty which you hold in lease
  Find no determination; then you were
  Yourself again, after yourself's decease,
  When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
  Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
  Which husbandry in honour might uphold,
  Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
  And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
        O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,
        You had a father: let your son say so.",Sonnet
13,William Shakespeare,"Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;
  And yet methinks I have astronomy,
  But not to tell of good or evil luck,
  Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
  Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
  Or say with princes if it shall go well
  By oft predict that I in heaven find:
  But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
  And constant stars in them I read such art
  As 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,
  If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert';
        Or else of thee this I prognosticate:
        'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.'",Sonnet
14,William Shakespeare,"When I consider every thing that grows
  Holds in perfection but a little moment,
  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
  Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
  When I perceive that men as plants increase,
  Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  And wear their brave state out of memory;
  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
  Where wasteful Time debateth with decay
  To change your day of youth to sullied night,
        And all in war with Time for love of you,
        As he takes from you, I engraft you new.",Sonnet
15,William Shakespeare,"But wherefore do not you a mightier way
  Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
  And fortify your self in your decay
  With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
  Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
  And many maiden gardens, yet unset,
  With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
  So should the lines of life that life repair,
  Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,
  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
  Can make you live your self in eyes of men.
        To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,
        And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.",Sonnet
16,William Shakespeare,"Who will believe my verse in time to come,
  If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?
  Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
  Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.
  If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
  And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
  The age to come would say 'This poet lies;
  Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'
  So should my papers, yellow'd with their age,
  Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,
  And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
  And stretched metre of an antique song:
        But were some child of yours alive that time,
        You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.",Sonnet
17,William Shakespeare,"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
  And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
  And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,
  And every fair from fair sometime declines,
  By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:
  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
  Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
  When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
        So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
        So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.",Sonnet
18,William Shakespeare,"Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
  And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
  And burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood;
  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
  And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
  To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
  But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
  O! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
  Him in thy course untainted do allow
  For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
        Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,
        My love shall in my verse ever live young.",Sonnet
19,William Shakespeare,"A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
  Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;
  A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
  With shifting change, as is false women's fashion:
  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
  A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,
  Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
  And for a woman wert thou first created;
  Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,
  And by addition me of thee defeated,
  By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
        But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,
        Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.",Sonnet
20,William Shakespeare,"So is it not with me as with that Muse,
  Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
  Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
  Making a couplement of proud compare.
  With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
  With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,
  That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
  O! let me, true in love, but truly write,
  And then believe me, my love is as fair
  As any mother's child, though not so bright
  As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:
        Let them say more that like of hearsay well;
        I will not praise that purpose not to sell.",Sonnet
21,William Shakespeare,"My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
  So long as youth and thou are of one date;
  But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
  Then look I death my days should expiate.
  For all that beauty that doth cover thee,
  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
  Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
  How can I then be elder than thou art?
  O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary
  As I, not for myself, but for thee will;
  Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
        Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,
        Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.",Sonnet
22,William Shakespeare,"As an unperfect actor on the stage,
  Who with his fear is put beside his part,
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
  So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
  The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
  And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
  O'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might.
  O! let my looks be then the eloquence
  And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
  More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
        O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:
        To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.",Sonnet
23,William Shakespeare,"Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd,
  Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
  And perspective it is best painter's art.
  For through the painter must you see his skill,
  To find where your true image pictur'd lies,
  Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
  That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
  Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
  Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
  Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;
        Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
        They draw but what they see, know not the heart.",Sonnet
24,William Shakespeare,"Let those who are in favour with their stars
  Of public honour and proud titles boast,
  Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars
  Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
  Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
  But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
  And in themselves their pride lies buried,
  For at a frown they in their glory die.
  The painful warrior famoused for fight,
  After a thousand victories once foil'd,
  Is from the book of honour razed quite,
  And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:
      Then happy I, that love and am belov'd,
      Where I may not remove nor be remov'd.",Sonnet
25,William Shakespeare,"Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
  Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,
  To thee I send this written embassage,
  To witness duty, not to show my wit:
  Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
  May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,
  But that I hope some good conceit of thine
  In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:
  Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,
  Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
  And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,
  To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
        Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
        Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.",Sonnet
26,William Shakespeare,"Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
  The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;
  But then begins a journey in my head
  To work my mind, when body's work's expired:
  For then my thoughts--from far where I abide--
  Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
  And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
  Looking on darkness which the blind do see:
  Save that my soul's imaginary sight
  Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
  Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,
  Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
        Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
        For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.",Sonnet
27,William Shakespeare,"How can I then return in happy plight,
  That am debarre'd the benefit of rest?
  When day's oppression is not eas'd by night,
  But day by night and night by day oppress'd,
  And each, though enemies to either's reign,
  Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
  The one by toil, the other to complain
  How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
  I tell the day, to please him thou art bright,
  And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
  So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,
  When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
        But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,
        And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.",Sonnet
28,William Shakespeare,"When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes
  I all alone beweep my outcast state,
  And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
  And look upon myself, and curse my fate,
  Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
  Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,
  Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
  With what I most enjoy contented least;
  Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,
  Haply I think on thee,-- and then my state,
  Like to the lark at break of day arising
  From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
        For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
        That then I scorn to change my state with kings.",Sonnet
29,William Shakespeare,"When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
  I summon up remembrance of things past,
  I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
  And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
  Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
  For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
  And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
  And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:
  Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
  And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
  The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
  Which I new pay as if not paid before.
        But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
        All losses are restor'd and sorrows end.",Sonnet
30,William Shakespeare,"Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
  Which I by lacking have supposed dead;
  And there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts,
  And all those friends which I thought buried.
  How many a holy and obsequious tear
  Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
  As interest of the dead, which now appear
  But things remov'd that hidden in thee lie!
  Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
  Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
  Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
  That due of many now is thine alone:
        Their images I lov'd, I view in thee,
        And thou--all they--hast all the all of me.",Sonnet
31,William Shakespeare,"If thou survive my well-contented day,
  When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover
  And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
  These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,
  Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
  And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Exceeded by the height of happier men.
  O! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
  'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,
  A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
  To march in ranks of better equipage:
        But since he died and poets better prove,
        Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.",Sonnet
32,William Shakespeare,"Full many a glorious morning have I seen
  Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
  Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
  Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
  Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
  With ugly rack on his celestial face,
  And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
  Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
  Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
  With all triumphant splendour on my brow;
  But out! alack! he was but one hour mine,
  The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
        Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
        Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.",Sonnet
33,William Shakespeare,"Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
  And make me travel forth without my cloak,
  To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
  Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
  'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
  To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
  For no man well of such a salve can speak,
  That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:
  Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
  Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
  The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
        Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
        And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.",Sonnet
34,William Shakespeare,"No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done:
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:
  Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
  All men make faults, and even I in this,
  Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
  Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
  For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,--
  Thy adverse party is thy advocate,--
  And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:
  Such civil war is in my love and hate,
        That I an accessary needs must be,
        To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.",Sonnet
35,William Shakespeare,"Let me confess that we two must be twain,
  Although our undivided loves are one:
  So shall those blots that do with me remain,
  Without thy help, by me be borne alone.
  In our two loves there is but one respect,
  Though in our lives a separable spite,
  Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
  Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
  I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
  Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
  Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
        But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
        As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.",Sonnet
36,William Shakespeare,"As a decrepit father takes delight
  To see his active child do deeds of youth,
  So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite,
  Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth;
  For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
  Or any of these all, or all, or more,
  Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,
  I make my love engrafted, to this store:
  So then I am not lame, poor, nor despis'd,
  Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
  That I in thy abundance am suffic'd,
  And by a part of all thy glory live.
        Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:
        This wish I have; then ten times happy me!",Sonnet
37,William Shakespeare,"How can my muse want subject to invent,
  While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse
  Thine own sweet argument, too excellent
  For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
  O! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me
  Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;
  For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
  When thou thy self dost give invention light?
  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
  Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;
  And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
        If my slight muse do please these curious days,
        The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.",Sonnet
38,William Shakespeare,"O! how thy worth with manners may I sing,
  When thou art all the better part of me?
  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
  And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
  Even for this, let us divided live,
  And our dear love lose name of single one,
  That by this separation I may give
  That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone.
  O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,
  Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
  Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,
        And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
        By praising him here who doth hence remain.",Sonnet
39,William Shakespeare,"Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all;
  What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
  All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more.
  Then, if for my love, thou my love receivest,
  I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest;
  But yet be blam'd, if thou thy self deceivest
  By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
  I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,
  Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
  And yet, love knows it is a greater grief
  To bear love's wrong, than hate's known injury.
        Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
        Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.",Sonnet
40,William Shakespeare,"Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,
  When I am sometime absent from thy heart,
  Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,
  For still temptation follows where thou art.
  Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,
  Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assail'd;
  And when a woman woos, what woman's son
  Will sourly leave her till he have prevail'd?
  Ay me! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
  And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,
  Who lead thee in their riot even there
  Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:--
        Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
        Thine by thy beauty being false to me.",Sonnet
41,William Shakespeare,"That thou hast her it is not all my grief,
  And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;
  That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
  A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
  Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye:
  Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her;
  And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
  Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
  If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
  And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;
  Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
  And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
        But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;
        Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.",Sonnet
42,William Shakespeare,"When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,
  For all the day they view things unrespected;
  But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
  And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.
  Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,
  How would thy shadow's form form happy show
  To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
  When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
  How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made
  By looking on thee in the living day,
  When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
  Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
        All days are nights to see till I see thee,
        And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.",Sonnet
43,William Shakespeare,"If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
  Injurious distance should not stop my way;
  For then despite of space I would be brought,
  From limits far remote, where thou dost stay.
  No matter then although my foot did stand
  Upon the farthest earth remov'd from thee;
  For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,
  As soon as think the place where he would be.
  But, ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,
  To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
  But that so much of earth and water wrought,
  I must attend time's leisure with my moan;
        Receiving nought by elements so slow
        But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.",Sonnet
44,William Shakespeare,"The other two, slight air, and purging fire
  Are both with thee, wherever I abide;
  The first my thought, the other my desire,
  These present-absent with swift motion slide.
  For when these quicker elements are gone
  In tender embassy of love to thee,
  My life, being made of four, with two alone
  Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;
  Until life's composition be recur'd
  By those swift messengers return'd from thee,
  Who even but now come back again, assur'd,
  Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:
        This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,
        I send them back again, and straight grow sad.",Sonnet
45,William Shakespeare,"Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,
  How to divide the conquest of thy sight;
  Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
  My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.
  My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,--
  A closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes--
  But the defendant doth that plea deny,
  And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
  To side this title is impannelled
  A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;
  And by their verdict is determined
  The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part:
        As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,
        And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.",Sonnet
46,William Shakespeare,"Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
  And each doth good turns now unto the other:
  When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,
  Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,
  With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,
  And to the painted banquet bids my heart;
  Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
  And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:
  So, either by thy picture or my love,
  Thyself away, art present still with me;
  For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
  And I am still with them, and they with thee;
        Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
        Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.",Sonnet
47,William Shakespeare,"How careful was I when I took my way,
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  That to my use it might unused stay
  From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!
  But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
  Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,
  Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,
  Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
  Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,
  Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
  Within the gentle closure of my breast,
  From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;
        And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,
        For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.",Sonnet
48,William Shakespeare,"Against that time, if ever that time come,
  When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
  When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
  Call'd to that audit by advis'd respects;
  Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
  And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,
  When love, converted from the thing it was,
  Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
  Against that time do I ensconce me here,
  Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
  And this my hand, against my self uprear,
  To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:
        To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,
        Since why to love I can allege no cause.",Sonnet
49,William Shakespeare,"How heavy do I journey on the way,
  When what I seek, my weary travel's end,
  Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,
  'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'
  The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
  Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,
  As if by some instinct the wretch did know
  His rider lov'd not speed, being made from thee:
  The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,
  That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,
  Which heavily he answers with a groan,
  More sharp to me than spurring to his side;
        For that same groan doth put this in my mind,
        My grief lies onward, and my joy behind.",Sonnet
50,William Shakespeare,"Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
  Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:
  From where thou art why should I haste me thence?
  Till I return, of posting is no need.
  O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,
  When swift extremity can seem but slow?
  Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,
  In winged speed no motion shall I know,
  Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
  Therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made,
  Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;
  But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,--
        'Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,
        Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.'",Sonnet
51,William Shakespeare,"So am I as the rich, whose blessed key,
  Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
  The which he will not every hour survey,
  For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.
  Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
  Since, seldom coming in that long year set,
  Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
  Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
  So is the time that keeps you as my chest,
  Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
  To make some special instant special-blest,
  By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.
        Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,
        Being had, to triumph; being lacked, to hope.",Sonnet
52,William Shakespeare,"What is your substance, whereof are you made,
  That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
  Since every one, hath every one, one shade,
  And you but one, can every shadow lend.
  Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit
  Is poorly imitated after you;
  On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
  And you in Grecian tires are painted new:
  Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,
  The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
  The other as your bounty doth appear;
  And you in every blessed shape we know.
        In all external grace you have some part,
        But you like none, none you, for constant heart.",Sonnet
53,William Shakespeare,"O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
  By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.
  The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
  For that sweet odour, which doth in it live.
  The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
  As the perfumed tincture of the roses.
  Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly
  When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
  But, for their virtue only is their show,
  They live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade;
  Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;
  Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:
        And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
        When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.",Sonnet
54,William Shakespeare,"Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
  Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;

  And broils root out the work of masonry,
  Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn
  The living record of your memory.
  'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity
  Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
  Even in the eyes of all posterity
  That wear this world out to the ending doom.

55,William Shakespeare,"Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said
  Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
  Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,
  To-morrow sharpened in his former might:
  So, love, be thou, although to-day thou fill
  Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,
  To-morrow see again, and do not kill
  The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.
  Let this sad interim like the ocean be
  Which parts the shore, where two contracted new
  Come daily to the banks, that when they see
  Return of love, more blest may be the view;
        Or call it winter, which being full of care,
        Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.",Sonnet
56,William Shakespeare,"Being your slave what should I do but tend,
  Upon the hours, and times of your desire?
  I have no precious time at all to spend;
  Nor services to do, till you require.
  Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,
  Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,
  Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,
  When you have bid your servant once adieu;
  Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
  Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
  But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
  Save, where you are, how happy you make those.
        So true a fool is love, that in your will,
        Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.",Sonnet
57,William Shakespeare,"That god forbid, that made me first your slave,

  Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,
  Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!
  O! let me suffer, being at your beck,
  The imprison'd absence of your liberty;
  And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,
  Without accusing you of injury.
  Be where you list, your charter is so strong
  That you yourself may privilage your time
  To what you will; to you it doth belong
  Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.
        I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,
        Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.",Sonnet
58,William Shakespeare,"If there be nothing new, but that which is

  The second burthen of a former child!
  O! that record could with a backward look,
  Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
  Show me your image in some antique book,
  Since mind at first in character was done!
  That I might see what the old world could say
  To this composed wonder of your frame;

59,William Shakespeare,"Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,

  In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
  Nativity, once in the main of light,
  Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,
  Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
  And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.
  Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
  And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
  Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,

        Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.",Sonnet
60,William Shakespeare,"Is it thy will, thy image should keep open
  My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
  Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
  While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
  Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
  So far from home into my deeds to pry,
  To find out shames and idle hours in me,
  The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?
  O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:
  It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:
  Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,

  Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
  No shape so true, no truth of such account;
  And for myself mine own worth do define,
  As I all other in all worths surmount.
  But when my glass shows me myself indeed
  Beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity,
  Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
  Self so self-loving were iniquity.

        Painting my age with beauty of thy days.",Sonnet
62,William Shakespeare,"Against my love shall be as I am now,
  With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn;

  With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
  Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night;
  And all those beauties whereof now he's king
  Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
  Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
  For such a time do I now fortify
  Against confounding age's cruel knife,
  That he shall never cut from memory
  My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:
        His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
        And they shall live, and he in them still green.",Sonnet
63,William Shakespeare,"When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd
  The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age;
  When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz'd,
  And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
  When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
  Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
  And the firm soil win of the watery main,
  Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;
  When I have seen such interchange of state,
  Or state itself confounded, to decay;
  Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate--
  That Time will come and take my love away.
        This thought is as a death which cannot choose
        But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.",Sonnet
64,William Shakespeare,"Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,

  How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
  Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
  O! how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
  Against the wrackful siege of battering days,
  When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
  Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays?

65,William Shakespeare,"Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,
  As to behold desert a beggar born,

  And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
  And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,
  And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
  And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,
  And strength by limping sway disabled
  And art made tongue-tied by authority,
  And folly--doctor-like--controlling skill,

  Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
  Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
  Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?

  To live a second life on second head;
  Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
  In him those holy antique hours are seen,
  Without all ornament, itself and true,

68,William Shakespeare,"Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view

  But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,
  In other accents do this praise confound
  By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
  They look into the beauty of thy mind,
  And that in guess they measure by thy deeds;
  Then--churls--their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,

  A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
  So thou be good, slander doth but approve
  Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;
  For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
  And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
  Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
  Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;
  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
  To tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd,

  As after sunset fadeth in the west;
  Which by and by black night doth take away,
  Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
  In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,
  That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
  As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,

  That every word doth almost tell my name,
  Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
  O! know sweet love I always write of you,
  And you and love are still my argument;

  Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
  And do so, love; yet when they have devis'd,
  What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
  Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz'd
  In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;
        And their gross painting might be better us'd
        Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abus'd.",Sonnet
82,William Shakespeare,"I never saw that you did painting need,
  And therefore to your fair no painting set;
  I found, or thought I found, you did exceed
  That barren tender of a poet's debt:
  And therefore have I slept in your report,
  That you yourself, being extant, well might show
  How far a modern quill doth come too short,
  Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
  This silence for my sin you did impute,
  Which shall be most my glory being dumb;
  For I impair not beauty being mute,
  When others would give life, and bring a tomb.
        There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
        Than both your poets can in praise devise.",Sonnet
83,William Shakespeare,"Who is it that says most, which can say more,
  Than this rich praise,--that you alone, are you?
  In whose confine immured is the store
  Which should example where your equal grew.
  Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
  That to his subject lends not some small glory;
  But he that writes of you, if he can tell
  That you are you, so dignifies his story,
  Let him but copy what in you is writ,
  Not making worse what nature made so clear,
  And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
  Making his style admired every where.
        You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
        Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.",Sonnet
84,William Shakespeare,"My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,
  While comments of your praise richly compil'd,
  Reserve their character with golden quill,
  And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd.
  I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,
  And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen'
  To every hymn that able spirit affords,
  In polish'd form of well-refined pen.
  Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,'
  And to the most of praise add something more;
  But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
  Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.
        Then others, for the breath of words respect,
        Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.",Sonnet
85,William Shakespeare,"Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
  Bound for the prize of all too precious you,
  That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
  Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
  Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
  Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
  No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
  Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
  He, nor that affable familiar ghost
  Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
  As victors of my silence cannot boast;
  I was not sick of any fear from thence:
        But when your countenance fill'd up his line,
        Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.",Sonnet
86,William Shakespeare,"Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
  And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
  The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
  My bonds in thee are all determinate.
  For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
  And for that riches where is my deserving?
  The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
  And so my patent back again is swerving.
  Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
  Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;
  So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
  Comes home again, on better judgement making.
        Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,
        In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.",Sonnet
87,William Shakespeare,"When thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,
  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
  Upon thy side, against myself I'll fight,
  And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.
  With mine own weakness, being best acquainted,
  Upon thy part I can set down a story
  Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted;
  That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:
  And I by this will be a gainer too;
  For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
  The injuries that to myself I do,
  Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
        Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
        That for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.",Sonnet
88,William Shakespeare,"Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
  And I will comment upon that offence:
  Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,
  Against thy reasons making no defence.
  Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill,
  To set a form upon desired change,
  As I'll myself disgrace; knowing thy will,
  I will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;
  Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue
  Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
  Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,
  And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
        For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,
        For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.",Sonnet
89,William Shakespeare,"Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;
  Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
  Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
  And do not drop in for an after-loss:
  Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scap'd this sorrow,
  Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;
  Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
  To linger out a purpos'd overthrow.
  If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
  When other petty griefs have done their spite,
  But in the onset come: so shall I taste
  At first the very worst of fortune's might;
        And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
        Compar'd with loss of thee, will not seem so.",Sonnet
90,William Shakespeare,"Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
  Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,
  Some in their garments though new-fangled ill;
  Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;
  And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
  Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:
  But these particulars are not my measure,
  All these I better in one general best.
  Thy love is better than high birth to me,
  Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,
  Of more delight than hawks and horses be;
  And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:
        Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take
        All this away, and me most wretchcd make.",Sonnet
91,William Shakespeare,"But do thy worst to steal thyself away,
  For term of life thou art assured mine;
  And life no longer than thy love will stay,
  For it depends upon that love of thine.
  Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
  When in the least of them my life hath end.
  I see a better state to me belongs
  Than that which on thy humour doth depend:
  Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
  Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.
  O! what a happy title do I find,
  Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
        But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
        Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.",Sonnet
92,William Shakespeare,"So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
  Like a deceived husband; so love's face
  May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;
  Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:
  For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
  Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.
  In many's looks, the false heart's history
  Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange.
  But heaven in thy creation did decree
  That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
  Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,
  Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.
        How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
        If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!",Sonnet
93,William Shakespeare,"They that have power to hurt, and will do none,
  That do not do the thing they most do show,
  Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
  Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;
  They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,
  And husband nature's riches from expense;
  They are the lords and owners of their faces,
  Others, but stewards of their excellence.
  The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
  Though to itself, it only live and die,
  But if that flower with base infection meet,
  The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
        For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
        Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.",Sonnet
94,William Shakespeare,"How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
  Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,
  Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
  O! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose.
  That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
  Making lascivious comments on thy sport,
  Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise;
  Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.
  O! what a mansion have those vices got
  Which for their habitation chose out thee,
  Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot
  And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!
        Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;
        The hardest knife ill-us'd doth lose his edge.",Sonnet
95,William Shakespeare,"Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;
  Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;
  Both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less:
  Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.
  As on the finger of a throned queen
  The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,
  So are those errors that in thee are seen
  To truths translated, and for true things deem'd.
  How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
  If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
  How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
  if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
        But do not so; I love thee in such sort,
        As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.",Sonnet
96,William Shakespeare,"How like a winter hath my absence been
  From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
  What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
  What old December's bareness everywhere!
  And yet this time removed was summer's time;
  The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
  Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
  Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
  Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
  But hope of orphans, and unfather'd fruit;
  For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
  And, thou away, the very birds are mute:
        Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,
        That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.",Sonnet
97,William Shakespeare,"From you have I been absent in the spring,
  When proud-pied April, dress'd in all his trim,
  Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,
  That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.
  Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
  Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
  Could make me any summer's story tell,
  Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:
  Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
  Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
  They were but sweet, but figures of delight,
  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
        Yet seem'd it winter still, and you away,
        As with your shadow I with these did play.",Sonnet
98,William Shakespeare,"The forward violet thus did I chide:
  Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
  If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
  Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
  In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd.
  The lily I condemned for thy hand,
  And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair;
  The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
  One blushing shame, another white despair;
  A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both,
  And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;
  But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth
  A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
        More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,
        But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.",Sonnet
99,William Shakespeare,"Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,
  To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
  Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
  Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
  Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,
  In gentle numbers time so idly spent;
  Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
  And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
  Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,
  If Time have any wrinkle graven there;
  If any, be a satire to decay,
  And make time's spoils despised every where.
        Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,
        So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.",Sonnet
100,William Shakespeare,"O truant Muse what shall be thy amends
  For thy neglect of truth in beauty dy'd?
  Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
  So dost thou too, and therein dignified.
  Make answer Muse: wilt thou not haply say,
  'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;
  Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;
  But best is best, if never intermix'd'?
  Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
  Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee
  To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
  And to be prais'd of ages yet to be.
        Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how
        To make him seem long hence as he shows now.",Sonnet
101,William Shakespeare,"My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;
  I love not less, though less the show appear;
  That love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,
  The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
  Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
  When I was wont to greet it with my lays;
  As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
  And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
  Not that the summer is less pleasant now
  Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
  But that wild music burthens every bough,
  And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
        Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:
        Because I would not dull you with my song.",Sonnet
102,William Shakespeare,"Alack! what poverty my Muse brings forth,
  That having such a scope to show her pride,
  The argument, all bare, is of more worth
  Than when it hath my added praise beside!
  O! blame me not, if I no more can write!
  Look in your glass, and there appears a face
  That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
  Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.
  Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,
  To mar the subject that before was well?
  For to no other pass my verses tend
  Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;
        And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,
        Your own glass shows you when you look in it.",Sonnet
103,William Shakespeare,"To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
  For as you were when first your eye I ey'd,
  Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,
  Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
  Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd,
  In process of the seasons have I seen,
  Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,
  Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
  Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,
  Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv'd;
  So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
  Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv'd:
        For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:
        Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.",Sonnet
104,William Shakespeare,"Let not my love be call'd idolatry,
  Nor my beloved as an idol show,
  Since all alike my songs and praises be
  To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
  Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
  Still constant in a wondrous excellence;
  Therefore my verse to constancy confin'd,
  One thing expressing, leaves out difference.
  'Fair, kind, and true,' is all my argument,
  'Fair, kind, and true,' varying to other words;
  And in this change is my invention spent,
  Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
        Fair, kind, and true, have often liv'd alone,
        Which three till now, never kept seat in one.",Sonnet
105,William Shakespeare,"When in the chronicle of wasted time
  I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
  And beauty making beautiful old rime,
  In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,
  Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
  Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
  I see their antique pen would have express'd
  Even such a beauty as you master now.
  So all their praises are but prophecies
  Of this our time, all you prefiguring;
  And for they looked but with divining eyes,
  They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
        For we, which now behold these present days,
        Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.",Sonnet
106,William Shakespeare,"Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
  Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,
  Can yet the lease of my true love control,
  Supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom.
  The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,
  And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
  Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,
  And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
  Now with the drops of this most balmy time,
  My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,
  Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rime,
  While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:
        And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
        When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.",Sonnet
107,William Shakespeare,"What's in the brain, that ink may character,
  Which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit?
  What's new to speak, what now to register,
  That may express my love, or thy dear merit?
  Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
  I must each day say o'er the very same;
  Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
  Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.
  So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
  Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
  Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
  But makes antiquity for aye his page;
        Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
        Where time and outward form would show it dead.",Sonnet
108,William Shakespeare,"O! never say that I was false of heart,
  Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify,
  As easy might I from my self depart
  As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:
  That is my home of love: if I have rang'd,
  Like him that travels, I return again;
  Just to the time, not with the time exchang'd,
  So that myself bring water for my stain.
  Never believe though in my nature reign'd,
  All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
  That it could so preposterously be stain'd,
  To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
        For nothing this wide universe I call,
        Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.",Sonnet
109,William Shakespeare,"Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
  And made my self a motley to the view,
  Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
  Made old offences of affections new;
  Most true it is, that I have look'd on truth
  Askance and strangely; but, by all above,
  These blenches gave my heart another youth,
  And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.
  Now all is done, save what shall have no end:
  Mine appetite I never more will grind
  On newer proof, to try an older friend,
  A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.
        Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
        Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.",Sonnet
110,William Shakespeare,"O! for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
  The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
  That did not better for my life provide
  Than public means which public manners breeds.
  Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
  And almost thence my nature is subdu'd
  To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
  Pity me, then, and wish I were renew'd;
  Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink,
  Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  Nor double penance, to correct correction.
        Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye,
        Even that your pity is enough to cure me.",Sonnet
111,William Shakespeare,"Your love and pity doth the impression fill,
  Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;
  For what care I who calls me well or ill,
  So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
  You are my all-the-world, and I must strive
  To know my shames and praises from your tongue;
  None else to me, nor I to none alive,
  That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.
  In so profound abysm I throw all care
  Of others' voices, that my adder's sense
  To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
  Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:
        You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
        That all the world besides methinks are dead.",Sonnet
112,William Shakespeare,"Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;
  And that which governs me to go about
  Doth part his function and is partly blind,
  Seems seeing, but effectually is out;
  For it no form delivers to the heart
  Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch:
  Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
  Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch;
  For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,
  The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,
  The mountain or the sea, the day or night:
  The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.
        Incapable of more, replete with you,
        My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.",Sonnet
113,William Shakespeare,"Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,
  Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?
  Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,
  And that your love taught it this alchemy,
  To make of monsters and things indigest
  Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
  Creating every bad a perfect best,
  As fast as objects to his beams assemble?
  O! 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,
  And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:
  Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,
  And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
        If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin
        That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.",Sonnet
114,William Shakespeare,"Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
  Even those that said I could not love you dearer:
  Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
  My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.
  But reckoning Time, whose million'd accidents
  Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,
  Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
  Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;
  Alas! why fearing of Time's tyranny,
  Might I not then say, 'Now I love you best,'
  When I was certain o'er incertainty,
  Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
        Love is a babe, then might I not say so,
        To give full growth to that which still doth grow?",Sonnet
115,William Shakespeare,"Let me not to the marriage of true minds
  Admit impediments. Love is not love
  Which alters when it alteration finds,
  Or bends with the remover to remove:
  O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,
  That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
  It is the star to every wandering bark,
  Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
  Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
  Within his bending sickle's compass come;
  Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
  But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me prov'd,
        I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.",Sonnet
116,William Shakespeare,"Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all,
  Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
  Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
  Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;
  That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
  And given to time your own dear-purchas'd right;
  That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
  Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
  Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
  And on just proof surmise, accumulate;
  Bring me within the level of your frown,
  But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;
        Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
        The constancy and virtue of your love.",Sonnet
117,William Shakespeare,"Like as, to make our appetite more keen,
  With eager compounds we our palate urge;
  As, to prevent our maladies unseen,
  We sicken to shun sickness when we purge;
  Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
  To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
  And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness
  To be diseas'd, ere that there was true needing.
  Thus policy in love, to anticipate
  The ills that were not, grew to faults assur'd,
  And brought to medicine a healthful state
  Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cur'd;

  Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,
  Still losing when I saw myself to win!
  What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
  Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!
  How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted,
  In the distraction of this madding fever!
  O benefit of ill! now I find true
  That better is, by evil still made better;
  And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,
  Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.

  And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
  To weigh how once I suffer'd in your crime.
  O! that our night of woe might have remember'd
  My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
  And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd

  Give salutation to my sportive blood?
  Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
  Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
  No, I am that I am, and they that level
  At my abuses reckon up their own:

122,William Shakespeare,"No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
  Thy pyramids built up with newer might
  To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
  They are but dressings of a former sight.
  Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
  What thou dost foist upon us that is old;
  And rather make them born to our desire
  Than think that we before have heard them told.
  Thy registers and thee I both defy,

  No, it was builded far from accident;
  It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
  Under the blow of thralled discontent,
  Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:
  It fears not policy, that heretic,
  Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,

  For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
  Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?
  No; let me be obsequious in thy heart,

  If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
  As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,
  She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
  May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.

  Fairing the foul with Art's false borrowed face,
  Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
  But is profan'd, if not lives in disgrace.
  Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
  Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem

  Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,
  At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!
  To be so tickled, they would change their state
  And situation with those dancing chips,

  I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
  But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
  And in some perfumes is there more delight
  Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
  I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
  That music hath a far more pleasing sound:

Be counted with the ungenerous.  Out, alas!
I will not soil thy purple with my dust,
Nor breathe my poison on thy Venice-glass,
Nor give thee any love—which were unjust.
Beloved, I only love thee! let it pass.",Sonnet
9,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed
And worthy of acceptation.  Fire is bright,
Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light
Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:
And love is fire.  And when I say at need
I love thee . . . mark! . . . I love thee—in thy sight
I stand transfigured, glorified aright,
With conscience of the new rays that proceed
Out of my face toward thine.  There’s nothing low
In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures
Who love God, God accepts while loving so.
And what I feel, across the inferior features
Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show
How that great work of Love enhances Nature’s.",Sonnet
10,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"And therefore if to love can be desert,
I am not all unworthy.  Cheeks as pale
As these you see, and trembling knees that fail
To bear the burden of a heavy heart,—
This weary minstrel-life that once was girt
To climb Aornus, and can scarce avail
To pipe now ’gainst the valley nightingale
A melancholy music,—why advert
To these things?  O Belovëd, it is plain
I am not of thy worth nor for thy place!
And yet, because I love thee, I obtain
From that same love this vindicating grace
To live on still in love, and yet in vain,—
To bless thee, yet renounce thee to thy face.",Sonnet
11,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"Indeed this very love which is my boast,
And which, when rising up from breast to brow,
Doth crown me with a ruby large enow
To draw men’s eyes and prove the inner cost,—
This love even, all my worth, to the uttermost,
I should not love withal, unless that thou
Hadst set me an example, shown me how,
When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed,
And love called love.  And thus, I cannot speak
Of love even, as a good thing of my own:
Thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak,
And placed it by thee on a golden throne,—
And that I love (O soul, we must be meek!)
Is by thee only, whom I love alone.",Sonnet
12,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"And wilt thou have me fashion into speech
The love I bear thee, finding words enough,
And hold the torch out, while the winds are rough,
Between our faces, to cast light on each?—
I drop it at thy feet.  I cannot teach
My hand to hold my spirits so far off
From myself—me—that I should bring thee proof
In words, of love hid in me out of reach.
Nay, let the silence of my womanhood
Commend my woman-love to thy belief,—
Seeing that I stand unwon, however wooed,
And rend the garment of my life, in brief,
By a most dauntless, voiceless fortitude,
Lest one touch of this heart convey its grief.",Sonnet
13,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"If thou must love me, let it be for nought
Except for love’s sake only.  Do not say
“I love her for her smile—her look—her way
Of speaking gently,—for a trick of thought
That falls in well with mine, and certes brought
A sense of pleasant ease on such a day”—
For these things in themselves, Belovëd, may
Be changed, or change for thee,—and love, so wrought,
May be unwrought so.  Neither love me for
Thine own dear pity’s wiping my cheeks dry,—
A creature might forget to weep, who bore
Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!
But love me for love’s sake, that evermore
Thou may’st love on, through love’s eternity.",Sonnet
14,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"Accuse me not, beseech thee, that I wear
Too calm and sad a face in front of thine;
For we two look two ways, and cannot shine
With the same sunlight on our brow and hair.
On me thou lookest with no doubting care,
As on a bee shut in a crystalline;
Since sorrow hath shut me safe in love’s divine,
And to spread wing and fly in the outer air
Were most impossible failure, if I strove
To fail so.  But I look on thee—on thee—
Beholding, besides love, the end of love,
Hearing oblivion beyond memory;
As one who sits and gazes from above,
Over the rivers to the bitter sea.",Sonnet
15,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"And yet, because thou overcomest so,
Because thou art more noble and like a king,
Thou canst prevail against my fears and fling
Thy purple round me, till my heart shall grow
Too close against thine heart henceforth to know
How it shook when alone.  Why, conquering
May prove as lordly and complete a thing
In lifting upward, as in crushing low!
And as a vanquished soldier yields his sword
To one who lifts him from the bloody earth,
Even so, Belovëd, I at last record,
Here ends my strife.  If thou invite me forth,
I rise above abasement at the word.
Make thy love larger to enlarge my worth!",Sonnet
16,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"My poet, thou canst touch on all the notes
God set between His After and Before,
And strike up and strike off the general roar
Of the rushing worlds a melody that floats
In a serene air purely.  Antidotes
Of medicated music, answering for
Mankind’s forlornest uses, thou canst pour
From thence into their ears.  God’s will devotes
Thine to such ends, and mine to wait on thine.
How, Dearest, wilt thou have me for most use?
A hope, to sing by gladly? or a fine
Sad memory, with thy songs to interfuse?
A shade, in which to sing—of palm or pine?
A grave, on which to rest from singing?  Choose.",Sonnet
17,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"I never gave a lock of hair away
To a man, Dearest, except this to thee,
Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully
I ring out to the full brown length and say
“Take it.”  My day of youth went yesterday;
My hair no longer bounds to my foot’s glee,
Nor plant I it from rose- or myrtle-tree,
As girls do, any more: it only may
Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,
Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside
Through sorrow’s trick.  I thought the
funeral-shears
Would take this first, but Love is justified,—
Take it thou,—finding pure, from all those years,
The kiss my mother left here when she died.",Sonnet
18,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"The soul’s Rialto hath its
merchandize;
I barter curl for curl upon that mart,
And from my poet’s forehead to my heart
Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,—
As purply black, as erst to Pindar’s eyes
The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart
The nine white Muse-brows.  For this counterpart, . . .
The bay crown’s shade, Belovëd, I surmise,
Still lingers on thy curl, it is so black!
Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath,
I tie the shadows safe from gliding back,
And lay the gift where nothing hindereth;
Here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack
No natural heat till mine grows cold in death.",Sonnet
19,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"Belovëd, my Belovëd, when I think
That thou wast in the world a year ago,
What time I sat alone here in the snow
And saw no footprint, heard the silence sink
No moment at thy voice, but, link by link,
Went counting all my chains as if that so
They never could fall off at any blow
Struck by thy possible hand,—why, thus I drink
Of life’s great cup of wonder!  Wonderful,
Never to feel thee thrill the day or night
With personal act or speech,—nor ever cull
Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white
Thou sawest growing!  Atheists are as dull,
Who cannot guess God’s presence out of sight.",Sonnet
20,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"Say over again, and yet once over again,
That thou dost love me.  Though the word repeated
Should seem a “cuckoo-song,” as thou dost treat
it,
Remember, never to the hill or plain,
Valley and wood, without her cuckoo-strain
Comes the fresh Spring in all her green completed.
Belovëd, I, amid the darkness greeted
By a doubtful spirit-voice, in that doubt’s pain
Cry, “Speak once more—thou lovest!”  Who
can fear
Too many stars, though each in heaven shall roll,
Too many flowers, though each shall crown the year?
Say thou dost love me, love me, love me—toll
The silver iterance!—only minding, Dear,
To love me also in silence with thy soul.",Sonnet
21,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"When our two souls stand up erect and
strong,
Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,
Until the lengthening wings break into fire
At either curvëd point,—what bitter wrong
Can the earth do to us, that we should not long
Be here contented?  Think!  In mounting higher,
The angels would press on us and aspire
To drop some golden orb of perfect song
Into our deep, dear silence.  Let us stay
Rather on earth, Belovëd,—where the unfit
Contrarious moods of men recoil away
And isolate pure spirits, and permit
A place to stand and love in for a day,
With darkness and the death-hour rounding it.",Sonnet
22,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"Is it indeed so?  If I lay here dead,
Wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine?
And would the sun for thee more coldly shine
Because of grave-damps falling round my head?
I marvelled, my Belovëd, when I read
Thy thought so in the letter.  I am thine—
But . . . so much to thee?  Can I pour thy wine
While my hands tremble?  Then my soul, instead
Of dreams of death, resumes life’s lower range.
Then, love me, Love! look on me—breathe on me!
As brighter ladies do not count it strange,
For love, to give up acres and degree,
I yield the grave for thy sake, and exchange
My near sweet view of heaven, for earth with thee!",Sonnet
23,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"Let the world’s sharpness like a clasping
knife
Shut in upon itself and do no harm
In this close hand of Love, now soft and warm,
And let us hear no sound of human strife
After the click of the shutting.  Life to life—
I lean upon thee, Dear, without alarm,
And feel as safe as guarded by a charm
Against the stab of worldlings, who if rife
Are weak to injure.  Very whitely still
The lilies of our lives may reassure
Their blossoms from their roots, accessible
Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer;
Growing straight, out of man’s reach, on the hill.
God only, who made us rich, can make us poor.",Sonnet
24,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"A heavy heart, Belovëd, have I borne
From year to year until I saw thy face,
And sorrow after sorrow took the place
Of all those natural joys as lightly worn
As the stringed pearls, each lifted in its turn
By a beating heart at dance-time.  Hopes apace
Were changed to long despairs, till God’s own grace
Could scarcely lift above the world forlorn
My heavy heart.  Then thou didst bid me bring
And let it drop adown thy calmly great
Deep being!  Fast it sinketh, as a thing
Which its own nature does precipitate,
While thine doth close above it, mediating
Betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate.",Sonnet
25,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"I lived with visions for my company
Instead of men and women, years ago,
And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know
A sweeter music than they played to me.
But soon their trailing purple was not free
Of this world’s dust, their lutes did silent grow,
And I myself grew faint and blind below
Their vanishing eyes.  Then thou didst come—to be,
Belovëd, what they seemed.  Their shining fronts,
Their songs, their splendours, (better, yet the same,
As river-water hallowed into fonts)
Met in thee, and from out thee overcame
My soul with satisfaction of all wants:
Because God’s gifts put man’s best dreams to
shame.",Sonnet
26,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"My own Belovëd, who hast lifted me
From this drear flat of earth where I was thrown,
And, in betwixt the languid ringlets, blown
A life-breath, till the forehead hopefully
Shines out again, as all the angels see,
Before thy saving kiss!  My own, my own,
Who camest to me when the world was gone,
And I who looked for only God, found thee!
I find thee; I am safe, and strong, and glad.
As one who stands in dewless asphodel,
Looks backward on the tedious time he had
In the upper life,—so I, with bosom-swell,
Make witness, here, between the good and bad,
That Love, as strong as Death, retrieves as well.",Sonnet
27,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"My letters! all dead paper, mute and white!
And yet they seem alive and quivering
Against my tremulous hands which loose the string
And let them drop down on my knee to-night.
This said,—he wished to have me in his sight
Once, as a friend: this fixed a day in spring
To come and touch my hand . . . a simple thing,
Yet I wept for it!—this, . . . the paper’s light . .
.
Said, Dear I love thee; and I sank and quailed
As if God’s future thundered on my past.
This said, I am thine—and so its ink has paled
With lying at my heart that beat too fast.
And this . . . O Love, thy words have ill availed
If, what this said, I dared repeat at last!",Sonnet
28,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"I think of thee!—my thoughts do twine and
bud
About thee, as wild vines, about a tree,
Put out broad leaves, and soon there’s nought to see
Except the straggling green which hides the wood.
Yet, O my palm-tree, be it understood
I will not have my thoughts instead of thee
Who art dearer, better!  Rather, instantly
Renew thy presence; as a strong tree should,
Rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare,
And let these bands of greenery which insphere thee,
Drop heavily down,—burst, shattered everywhere!
Because, in this deep joy to see and hear thee
And breathe within thy shadow a new air,
I do not think of thee—I am too near thee.",Sonnet
29,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"I see thine image through my tears to-night,
And yet to-day I saw thee smiling.  How
Refer the cause?—Belovëd, is it thou
Or I, who makes me sad?  The acolyte
Amid the chanted joy and thankful rite
May so fall flat, with pale insensate brow,
On the altar-stair.  I hear thy voice and vow,
Perplexed, uncertain, since thou art out of sight,
As he, in his swooning ears, the choir’s amen.
Belovëd, dost thou love? or did I see all
The glory as I dreamed, and fainted when
Too vehement light dilated my ideal,
For my soul’s eyes?  Will that light come again,
As now these tears come—falling hot and real?",Sonnet
30,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"Thou comest! all is said without a word.
I sit beneath thy looks, as children do
In the noon-sun, with souls that tremble through
Their happy eyelids from an unaverred
Yet prodigal inward joy.  Behold, I erred
In that last doubt! and yet I cannot rue
The sin most, but the occasion—that we two
Should for a moment stand unministered
By a mutual presence.  Ah, keep near and close,
Thou dove-like help! and when my fears would rise,
With thy broad heart serenely interpose:
Brood down with thy divine sufficiencies
These thoughts which tremble when bereft of those,
Like callow birds left desert to the skies.",Sonnet
31,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"The first time that the sun rose on thine
oath
To love me, I looked forward to the moon
To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon
And quickly tied to make a lasting troth.
Quick-loving hearts, I thought, may quickly loathe;
And, looking on myself, I seemed not one
For such man’s love!—more like an out-of-tune
Worn viol, a good singer would be wroth
To spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste,
Is laid down at the first ill-sounding note.
I did not wrong myself so, but I placed
A wrong on thee.  For perfect strains may float
’Neath master-hands, from instruments defaced,—
And great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat.",Sonnet
32,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"Yes, call me by my pet-name! let me hear
The name I used to run at, when a child,
From innocent play, and leave the cowslips plied,
To glance up in some face that proved me dear
With the look of its eyes.  I miss the clear
Fond voices which, being drawn and reconciled
Into the music of Heaven’s undefiled,
Call me no longer.  Silence on the bier,
While I call God—call God!—so let thy mouth
Be heir to those who are now exanimate.
Gather the north flowers to complete the south,
And catch the early love up in the late.
Yes, call me by that name,—and I, in truth,
With the same heart, will answer and not wait.",Sonnet
33,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"With the same heart, I said, I’ll answer
thee
As those, when thou shalt call me by my name—
Lo, the vain promise! is the same, the same,
Perplexed and ruffled by life’s strategy?
When called before, I told how hastily
I dropped my flowers or brake off from a game.
To run and answer with the smile that came
At play last moment, and went on with me
Through my obedience.  When I answer now,
I drop a grave thought, break from solitude;
Yet still my heart goes to thee—ponder how—
Not as to a single good, but all my good!
Lay thy hand on it, best one, and allow
That no child’s foot could run fast as this blood.",Sonnet
34,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"If I leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange
And be all to me?  Shall I never miss
Home-talk and blessing and the common kiss
That comes to each in turn, nor count it strange,
When I look up, to drop on a new range
Of walls and floors, another home than this?
Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is
Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change
That’s hardest.  If to conquer love, has tried,
To conquer grief, tries more, as all things prove,
For grief indeed is love and grief beside.
Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love.
Yet love me—wilt thou?  Open thy heart wide,
And fold within, the wet wings of thy dove.",Sonnet
35,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"When we met first and loved, I did not build
Upon the event with marble.  Could it mean
To last, a love set pendulous between
Sorrow and sorrow?  Nay, I rather thrilled,
Distrusting every light that seemed to gild
The onward path, and feared to overlean
A finger even.  And, though I have grown serene
And strong since then, I think that God has willed
A still renewable fear . . . O love, O troth . . .
Lest these enclaspëd hands should never hold,
This mutual kiss drop down between us both
As an unowned thing, once the lips being cold.
And Love, be false! if he, to keep one oath,
Must lose one joy, by his life’s star foretold.",Sonnet
36,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"Pardon, oh, pardon, that my soul should make
Of all that strong divineness which I know
For thine and thee, an image only so
Formed of the sand, and fit to shift and break.
It is that distant years which did not take
Thy sovranty, recoiling with a blow,
Have forced my swimming brain to undergo
Their doubt and dread, and blindly to forsake
Thy purity of likeness and distort
Thy worthiest love to a worthless counterfeit.
As if a shipwrecked Pagan, safe in port,
His guardian sea-god to commemorate,
Should set a sculptured porpoise, gills a-snort
And vibrant tail, within the temple-gate.",Sonnet
37,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"First time he kissed me, he but only kissed
The fingers of this hand wherewith I write;
And ever since, it grew more clean and white.
Slow to world-greetings, quick with its “O, list,”
When the angels speak.  A ring of amethyst
I could not wear here, plainer to my sight,
Than that first kiss.  The second passed in height
The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed,
Half falling on the hair.  O beyond meed!
That was the chrism of love, which love’s own crown,
With sanctifying sweetness, did precede
The third upon my lips was folded down
In perfect, purple state; since when, indeed,
I have been proud and said, “My love, my own.”",Sonnet
38,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"Because thou hast the power and own’st
the grace
To look through and behind this mask of me,
(Against which, years have beat thus blanchingly,
With their rains,) and behold my soul’s true face,
The dim and weary witness of life’s race,—
Because thou hast the faith and love to see,
Through that same soul’s distracting lethargy,
The patient angel waiting for a place
In the new Heavens,—because nor sin nor woe,
Nor God’s infliction, nor death’s neighbourhood,
Nor all which others viewing, turn to go,
Nor all which makes me tired of all, self-viewed,—
Nothing repels thee, . . . Dearest, teach me so
To pour out gratitude, as thou dost, good!",Sonnet
39,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"Oh, yes! they love through all this world of
ours!
I will not gainsay love, called love forsooth:
I have heard love talked in my early youth,
And since, not so long back but that the flowers
Then gathered, smell still.  Mussulmans and Giaours
Throw kerchiefs at a smile, and have no ruth
For any weeping.  Polypheme’s white tooth
Slips on the nut if, after frequent showers,
The shell is over-smooth,—and not so much
Will turn the thing called love, aside to hate
Or else to oblivion.  But thou art not such
A lover, my Belovëd! thou canst wait
Through sorrow and sickness, to bring souls to touch,
And think it soon when others cry “Too late.”",Sonnet
40,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"I thank all who have loved me in their
hearts,
With thanks and love from mine.  Deep thanks to all
Who paused a little near the prison-wall
To hear my music in its louder parts
Ere they went onward, each one to the mart’s
Or temple’s occupation, beyond call.
But thou, who, in my voice’s sink and fall
When the sob took it, thy divinest Art’s
Own instrument didst drop down at thy foot
To harken what I said between my tears, . . .
Instruct me how to thank thee!  Oh, to shoot
My soul’s full meaning into future years,
That they should lend it utterance, and salute
Love that endures, from life that disappears!",Sonnet
41,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"My future will not copy fair my past—
I wrote that once; and thinking at my side
My ministering life-angel justified
The word by his appealing look upcast
To the white throne of God, I turned at last,
And there, instead, saw thee, not unallied
To angels in thy soul!  Then I, long tried
By natural ills, received the comfort fast,
While budding, at thy sight, my pilgrim’s staff
Gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled.
I seek no copy now of life’s first half:
Leave here the pages with long musing curled,
And write me new my future’s epigraph,
New angel mine, unhoped for in the world!",Sonnet
42,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"How do I love thee?  Let me count the
ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
I love thee to the level of everyday’s
Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after death.",Sonnet
43,Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"Belovëd, thou hast brought me many
flowers
Plucked in the garden, all the summer through,
And winter, and it seemed as if they grew
In this close room, nor missed the sun and showers.
So, in the like name of that love of ours,
Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too,
And which on warm and cold days I withdrew
From my heart’s ground.  Indeed, those beds and
bowers
Be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue,
And wait thy weeding; yet here’s eglantine,
Here’s ivy!—take them, as I used to do
Thy flowers, and keep them where they shall not pine.
Instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true,
And tell thy soul, their roots are left in mine.",Sonnet

Though not in these, in rithmes not wholly dumb,

A better lover, and much better poet.
Nor is my Muse or I ashamed to owe it
To those true numerous graces, whereof some
But charm the senses, others overcome
Both brains and hearts; and mine now best do know it:
For in your verse all Cupids armory,
His flames, his shafts, his quiver, and his bow,
His very eyes are yours to overthrow.

Repair me now, for now mine end doth haste,

And all my pleasures are like yesterday;

Despair behind, and death before doth cast
Such terror, and my feebled flesh doth waste
By sin in it, which it towards hell doth weigh.
Only thou art above, and when towards thee
By thy leave I can look, I rise again;
But our old subtle foe so tempteth me,

What! is it she which on the other shore
Goes richly painted? or which, robb'd and tore,

Is she self-truth, and errs? now new, now outwore?
Doth she, and did she, and shall she evermore
On one, on seven, or on no hill appear?
Dwells she with us, or like adventuring knights
First travel we to seek, and then make love?

To seek thee, God; so streams do show the head;
But though I have found thee, and thou my thirst hast fed,
A holy thirsty dropsy melts me yet.
But why should I beg more love, whenas thou
Dost woo my soul, for hers off'ring all thine,
And dost not only fear lest I allow
My love to saints and angels, things divine,

Lest the world, flesh, yea devil put thee out.",Sonnet

With lovely tincture which Apollos dims.
His lips ripe strawberries in nectar wet,
    His mouth a Hive, his tongue a hony-combe,
    Where Muses (like bees) make their mansion.
His teeth pure pearle in blushing correll set.

    Be slow to love, and quicke to hate, enduring?",Sonnet
8,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,
That she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain,
Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,
Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,
I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe,
Studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain,
Oft turning others leaves, to see if thence would flow
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburned brain.
But words came halting forth, wanting Inventions stay:
Invention, Natures child, fled step-dame Studys blows,
And others feet still seemed but strangers in my way.
Thus great with child to speak, and helpless in my throes,
Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite:
Fool, said my Muse to me, look in thy heart and write.",Sonnet

Which hold my life in their dead doing might
Shall handle you and hold in loves soft bands,
Lyke captives trembling at the victors sight.
And happy lines, on which with starry light,
Those lamping eyes will deigne sometimes to look
And reade the sorrowes of my dying spright,
Written with teares in harts close bleeding book.
And happy rymes bathd in the sacred brooke,
Of Helicon whence she derived is,
When ye behold that Angels blessed looke,
My soules long lacked foode, my heavens blis.
Leaves, lines, and rymes, seeke her to please alone,
Whom if ye please, I care for other none.

Not air; for she is not so light or rare:

0,Tibullus,"Give, if thou wilt, for gold a life of toil!
    Let endless acres claim thy care!
  While sounds of war thy fearful slumbers spoil,
    And far-off trumpets scare!

  To me my poverty brings tranquil hours;
    My lowly hearth-stone cheerly shines;
  My modest garden bears me fruit and flowers,
    And plenteous native wines.

  I set my tender vines with timely skill,
    Or pluck large apples from the bough;
  Or goad my lazy steers to work my will,
    Or guide my own rude plough.

  Full tenderly upon my breast I bear
    A lamb or small kid gone astray;
  And yearly worship with my swains prepare,
    The shepherd's ancient way.

  I love those rude shrines in a lonely field
    Where rustic faith the god reveres,
  Or flower-crowned cross-road mile-stones, half concealed
    By gifts of travellers.

  Whatever fruit the kindly seasons show,
    Due tribute to our gods I pour;
  O'er Ceres' brows the tasseled wheat I throw,
    Or wreathe her temple door.

  My plenteous orchards fear no pelf or harm,
    By red Priapus sentinelled;
  By his huge sickle's formidable charm
    The bird thieves are dispelled.

  With offerings at my hearth, and faithful fires,
    My Lares I revere: not now
  As when with greater gifts my wealthier sires
    Performed the hallowing vow.

  No herds have I like theirs: I only bring
    One white lamb from my little fold,
  While my few bondmen at the altar sing
    Our harvest anthems old.

  Gods of my hearth! ye never learned to slight
    A poor man's gift. My bowls of clay
  To ye are hallowed by the cleansing rite,
    The best, most ancient way.

  If from my sheep the thief, the wolf, be driven,
    If fatter flocks allure them more,
  To me the riches to my fathers given
    Kind Heaven need not restore.

  My small, sure crop contents me; and the storm
    That pelts my thatch breaks not my rest,
  While to my heart I clasp the beauteous form
    Of her it loves the best.

  My simple cot brings such secure repose,
    When so companioned I can lie,
  That winds of winter and the whirling snows
    Sing me soft lullaby.

  This lot be mine! I envy not their gold
    Who rove the furious ocean foam:
  A frugal life will all my pleasures hold,
    If love be mine, and home.

  Enough I travel, if I steal away
    To sleep at noon-tide by the flow
  Of some cool stream. Could India's jewels pay
    For longer absence? No!

  Let great Messala vanquish land and sea,
    And deck with spoils his golden hall!
  I am myself a conquest, and must be
    My Delia's captive thrall.

  Be Delia mine, and Fame may flout and scorn,
    Or brand me with the sluggard's name!
  With cheerful hands I'll plant my upland corn,
    And live to laugh at Fame.

  If I might hold my Delia to my side,
    The bare ground were a happier bed
  Than theirs who, on a couch of silken pride,
    Must mourn for love long dead.

  Gilt couch, soft down, slow fountains murmuring song—
    These bring no peace. Befooled by words
  Was he who, when in love a victor strong,
    Left it for spoils and swords.

  For such let sad Cilicia's captives bleed,
    Her citadels his legions hold!
  And let him stride his swift, triumphal steed,
    In silvered robes or gold!

  These eyes of mine would look on only thee
    In that last hour when light shall fail.
  Embrace me, dear, in death! Let thy hand be
    In my cold fingers pale!

  With thine own arms my lifeless body lay
    On that cold couch so soon on fire!
  Give thy last kisses to my grateful clay,
    And weep beside my pyre!

  And weep! Ah, me! Thy heart will wear no steel
    Nor be stone-cold that rueful day:
  Thy faithful grief may all true lovers feel
    Nor tearless turn away!

  Yet ask I not that thou shouldst vex my shade
    With cheek all wan and blighted brow:
  But, O, to-day be love's full tribute paid,
    While the swift Fates allow.

  Soon Death, with shadow-mantled head, will come,
    Soon palsied age will creep our way,
  Bidding love's flatteries at last be dumb,
    Unfit for old and gray.

  But light-winged Venus still is smiling fair:
    By night or noon we heed her call;
  To pound on midnight doors I still may dare,
    Or brave for love a brawl.

  I am a soldier and a captain good
    In love's campaign, and calmly yield
  To all who hunger after wounds and blood,
    War's trumpet-echoing field.

  Ye toils and triumphs unto glory dear!
    Ye riches home from conquest borne!
  If my small fields their wonted harvest bear,
    Both wealth and want I scorn!",Elegy
1,Tibullus,"Bring larger bowls and give my sorrows wine,
    By heaviest slumbers be my brain possessed!
  Soothe my sad brows with Bacchus' gift divine,
    Nor wake me while my hapless passions rest!

  For Delia's jealous master at her door
    Has set a watch, and bolts it with stern steel.
  May wintry tempests strike it o'er and o'er,
    And amorous Jove crash through with thunder-peal!

  My sighs alone, O Door, should pierce thee through,
    Or backward upon soundless hinges turn.
  The curses my mad rhymes upon thee threw,—
    Forgive them!—Ah! in my own breast they burn!

  May I not move thee to remember now
    How oft, dear Door, thou wert love's place of prayer?
  While with fond kiss and supplicating vow,
    I hung thee o'er with many a garland fair?

  In vain the prayer! Thine own resolve must break
    Thy prison, Delia, and its guards evade.
  Bid them defiance for thy lover's sake!
    Be bold!   The brave bring Venus to their aid.

  'Tis Venus guides a youth through doors unknown;
    'Tis taught of her, a maid with firm-set lips
  Steals from her soft couch, silent and alone,
    And noiseless to her tryst securely trips.

  Her art it is, if with a husband near,
    A lady darts a love-lorn look and smile
  To one more blest; but languid sloth and fear
    Receive not Venus' perfect gift of guile.

  Trust Venus, too, t' avert the wretched wrath
    Of footpad, hungry for thy robe and ring!
  So safe and sacred is a lover's path,
    That common caution to the winds we fling.

  Oft-times I fail the wintry frost to feel,
    And drenching rains unheeded round me pour,
  If Delia comes at last with mute appeal,
    And, finger on her lip, throws wide the door.

  Away those lamps! Thou, man or maid, away!
    Great Venus wills not that her gifts be scanned.
  Ask me no names! Walk lightly there, I pray!
    Hold back thy tell-tale torch and curious hand!

  Yet fear not! Should some slave our loves behold,
    Let him look on, and at his liking stare!
  Hereafter not a whisper shall be told;
    By all the gods our innocence he'll swear.

  Or should one such from prudent silence swerve
    The chatterer who prates of me and thee
  Shall learn, too late, why Venus, whom I serve,
    Was born of blood upon a storm-swept sea.

  Nay, even thy husband will believe no ill.
    All this a wondrous witch did tell me true:
  One who can guide the stars to work her will,
    Or turn a torrent's course her task to do.

  Her spells call forth pale spectres from their graves,
    And charm bare bones from smoking pyres away:
  'Mid trooping ghosts with fearful shriek she raves,
    Then sprinkles with new milk, and holds at bay.

  She has the power to scatter tempests rude,
    And snows in summer at her whisper fall;
  The horrid simples by Medea brewed
    Are hers; she holds the hounds of Hell in thrall.

  For me a charm this potent witch did weave;
    Thrice if thou sing, then speak with spittings three,
  Thy husband not one witness will believe,
    Nor his own eyes, if our embrace they see!

  But tempt not others!   He will surely spy
    All else—to me, me only, magic-blind!
  And, hark! the hag with drugs, she said, would try
    To heal love's madness and my heart unbind.

  One cloudless night, with smoky torch, she burned
    Black victims to her gods of sorcery;
  Yet asked I not love's loss, but love returned,
    And would not wish for life, if robbed of thee.",Elegy
2,Tibullus,"Am I abandoned? Does Messala sweep
    Yon wide Aegean wave, not any more
  He, nor my mates, remembering where I weep,
    Struck down by fever on this alien shore?

  Spare me, dark death! I have no mother here,
    To clasp my relics to her widowed breast;
  No sister, to pour forth with hallowing tear
    Assyrian incense where my ashes rest.

  Nor Delia, who, before she said adieu,
    Asked omens fair at every potent shrine.
  Thrice did the ministrants give blessings true,
    The thrice-cast lot returned the lucky sign.

  All promised safe return;  but she had fears
    And doubting sorrows, which implored my stay;
  While I, though all was ready, dried her tears,
    And found fresh pretext for one more delay.

  An evil bird, I cried, did near me flit,
    Or luckless portent thrust my plans aside;
  Or Saturn's day, unhallowed and unfit,
    Forbade a journey from my Delia's side.

  Full oft, when starting on the fatal track,
    My stumbling feet foretold unhappy hours:
  Ah! he who journeys when love calls him back,
    Should know he disobeys celestial powers!

  Help me, great Goddess! For thy healing power
    The votive tablets on thy shrine display.
  See Delia there outwatch the midnight hour,
    Sitting, white-stoled, until the dawn of day!

  Each day her tresses twice she doth unbind,
    And sings, the loveliest of the Pharian band.
  O that my fathers' gods this prayer could find!
    Gods of my hearth and of my native land!

  How happily men lived when Saturn reigned!
    Ere weary highways crossed the fair young world,
  Ere lofty ships the purple seas disdained,
    Their swelling canvas to the winds unfurled!

  No roving seaman, from a distant course,
    Filled full of far-fetched wares his frail ship's hold:
  At home, the strong bull stood unyoked; the horse
    Endured no bridle in the age of gold.

  Men's houses had no doors? No firm-set rock
    Marked field from field by niggard masters held.
  The very oaks ran honey; the mild flock
    Brought home its swelling udders, uncompelled.

  Nor wrath nor war did that blest kingdom know;
    No craft was taught in old Saturnian time,
  By which the frowning smith, with blow on blow,
    Could forge the furious sword and so much crime.

  Now Jove is king! Now have we carnage foul,
    And wreckful seas, and countless ways to die.
  Nay! spare me, Father Jove, for on my soul
    Nor perjury, nor words blaspheming lie.

  If longer life I ask of Fate in vain,
    O'er my frail dust this superscription be:—
""Here Death's dark hand TIBULLUS doth detain,
Messala's follower over land and sea!""

  Then, since my soul to love did always yield,
    Let Venus guide it the immortal way,
  Where dance and song fill all th' Elysian field,
    And music that will never die away.

  There many a song-bird with his fellow sails,
    And cheerly carols on the cloudless air;
  Each grove breathes incense; all the happy vales
    O'er-run with roses, numberless and fair.

  Bright bands of youth with tender maidens stray,
    Led by the love-god all delights to share;
  And each fond lover death once snatched away
    Winds an immortal myrtle in his hair.

  Far, far from such, the dreadful realms of gloom
    By those black streams of Hades circled round,
  Where viper-tressed, fierce ministers of doom,—
    The Furies drive lost souls from bound to bound.

  The doors of brass, and dragon-gate of Hell,
    Grim Cerberus guards, and frights the phantoms back:
  Ixion, who by Juno's beauty fell,
    Gives his frail body to the whirling rack.

  Stretched o'er nine roods, lies Tityos accursed,
    The vulture at his vitals feeding slow;
  There Tantalus, whose bitter, burning thirst
    The fleeting waters madden as they flow.

  There Danaus' daughters Venus' anger feel,
    Filling their urns at Lethe all in vain;—
And there's the wretch who would my Delia steal,
And wish me absent on a long campaign!

  O chaste and true! In thy still house shall sit
    The careful crone who guards thy virtuous bed;
  She tells thee tales, and when the lamps are lit,
    Reels from her distaff the unending thread.

  Some evening, after tasks too closely plied,
    My Delia, drowsing near the harmless dame,
  All sweet surprise, will find me at her side,
    Unheralded, as if from heaven I came.

  Then to my arms, in lovely disarray,
    With welcome kiss, thy darling feet will fly!
  O happy dream and prayer! O blissful day!
    What golden dawn, at last, shall bring thee nigh?",Elegy
3,Tibullus,"""Safe in the shelter of thy garden-bower,
  ""Priapus, from the harm of suns or snows,
  ""With beard all shag, and hair that wildly flows,—
  ""O say! o'er beauteous youth whence comes thy power?
  ""Naked thou frontest wintry nights and days,
  ""Naked, no less, to Sirius' burning rays.""

  So did my song implore the rustic son
  Of Bacchus, by his moon-shaped sickle known.

  ""Comply with beauty's lightest wish,"" said he,
  ""Complying love leads best to victory.
  ""Nor let a furious 'No' thy bosom pain;
  ""Beauty but slowly can endure a chain.
  ""Slow Time the rage of lions will o'er-sway,
  ""And bid them fawn on man. Rough rocks and rude
  ""In gentle streams Time smoothly wears away;
  ""And on the vine-clad hills by sunshine wooed,
  ""The purpling grapes feel Time's secure control;
  ""In Time, the skies themselves new stars unroll.
  ""Fear not  great oaths! Love's broken oaths are borne
  ""Unharmed of heaven o'er every wind and wave.
  ""Jove is most mild; and he himself hath sworn
  ""There is no force in vows which lovers rave.
  ""Falsely by Dian's arrows boldly swear!
  ""And perjure thee by chaste Minerva's hair!

  ""Be a prompt wooer, if thou wouldst be wise:
  ""Time is in flight, and never backward flies.
  ""How swiftly fades the bloom, the vernal green!
  ""How swift yon poplar dims its silver sheen!
  ""Spurning the goal th' Olympian courser flies,
  ""Then yields to Time his strength, his victories;
  ""And oft I see sad, fading youth deplore
  ""Each hour it lost, each pleasure it forbore.
  ""Serpents each spring look young once more; harsh Heaven
  ""To beauteous youth has one brief season given.
  ""With never-fading youth stern Fate endows
  ""Phoebus and Bacchus only, and allows
  ""Full-clustering ringlets on their lovely brows.

  ""Keep at thy loved one's side, though hour by hour
  ""The path runs on; though Summer's parching star
  ""Burn all the fields, or blackest tempests lower,
  ""Or monitory rainbows threaten far.
  ""If he would hasten o'er the purple sea,
  ""Thyself the helmsman or the oarsman be.
  ""Endure, unmurmuring, each unwelcome toil,
  ""Nor fear thy unaccustomed hands to spoil.
  ""If to the hills he goes with huntsman's snare,
  ""Let thine own back the nets and burden bear.
  ""Swords would he have? Fence lightly when you meet;
  ""Expose thy body and compel defeat.
  ""He will be gracious then, and will not spurn
  ""Caresses to receive, resist, return.
  ""He will protest, relent, and half-conspire,
  ""And later, all unasked, thy love desire.

  ""But nay! In these vile times thy skill is vain.
  ""Beauty and youth are sold for golden gain.
  ""May he who first taught love to sell and buy,
  ""In grave accurst, with all his riches lie!

  ""O beauteous youth, how will ye dare to slight
  ""The Muse, to whom Pierian streams belong?
  ""Will ye not smile on poets, and delight,
  ""More than all golden gifts, in gift of song?
  ""Did not some song empurple Nisus' hair,
  ""And bid young Pelops' ivory shoulder glow?
  ""That youth the Muses praise, is he not fair,
  ""Long as the stars shall shine or waters flow ?

  ""But he who scorns the Muse, and will for gain
  ""Surrender his base heart,—let his foul cries
  ""Pursue the Corybants' infuriate train,
  ""Through all the cities of the Phrygian plain,—
  ""Unmanned forever, in foul Phrygian guise!
  ""But Venus blesses lovers who endear
  ""Love's quest alone by flattery, by fear,
  ""By supplication, plaint, and piteous tear.""

  Such song the god of gardens bade me sing
  For Titius; but his fond wife would fling
  Such counsel to the winds: ""Beware,"" she cried,
  ""Trust not fair youth too far. For each one's pride
  ""Offers alluring charms: one loves to ride
  ""A gallant horse, and rein him firmly in;
  ""One cleaves the calm wave with white shoulder bare;
  ""One is all courage, and for this looks fair;
  ""And one's pure, blushing cheeks thy praises win.""

  Let him obey her! But my precepts wise
  Are meant for all whom youthful beauty's eyes
  Turn from in scorn. Let each his glory boast!
  Mine is, that lovers, when despairing most,
  My clients should be called. For them my door
  Stands hospitably open evermore.
  Philosopher to Venus I shall be,
  And throngs of studious youth will learn of me.

  Alas! alas! How love has been my bane!
  My cunning fails, and all my arts are vain.
  Have mercy, fair one, lest my pupils all
  Mock me, who point a path in which I fall!",Elegy
4,Tibullus,"With haughty frown I swore I could employ
    Thine absence well. But all my pride is o'er!
  Now am I lashed, as when a madcap boy
    Whirls a swift top along the level floor.

  Aye! Twist me! Plague me! Never shall I say
    Such boast again. Thy scorn and anger spare!
  Spare me!—by all our stolen loves I pray,
    By Venus,—by thy wealth of plaited hair!

  Was it not I, when fever laid thee low,
    Whose holy rites and offerings set thee free?
  Thrice round thy bed with brimstone did I go,
    While the wise witch sang healing charms for thee.

  Lest evil dreams should vex thee, I did bring
    That worshipped wafer by the Vestal given;
  Then, with loose robes and linen stole, did sing
    Nine prayers to  Hecate 'neath the midnight heaven.

  All rites were done! Yet doth a rival hold
    My darling, and my futile prayers deride:
  For I dreamed madly of a life all gold,
    If she were healed,—but Heaven the dream denied.

  A pleasant country-seat, whose orchards yield
    Sweet fruit to be my Delia's willing care,
  While our full corn-crop in the sultry field
    Stands ripe and dry! O, but my dreams were fair!

  She in the vine-vat will our clusters press,
    And tread the rich must with her dancing feet;
  She oft my sheep will number, oft caress
    Some pretty, prattling slave with kisses sweet.

  She offers Pan due tributes of our wealth,
    Grapes for the vine, and for a field of corn
  Wheat in the ear, or for the sheep-fold's health
    Some frugal feast is to his altar borne.

  Of all my house let her the mistress be!
    I am displaced and give not one command!
  Then let Messala come! From each choice tree
    Let Delia pluck him fruit with her soft hand!

  To serve and please so worshipful a guest,
    She spends her utmost art and anxious care;
  Asks his least wish, and spreads her dainty best,
    Herself the hostess and hand-maiden fair.

  Mad hope! The storm-winds bore away that dream
    Far as Armenia's perfume-breathing bids.
  Great Venus! Did I at thy shrine blaspheme?
    Am I accursed for rash and impious words?

  Had I, polluted, touched some altar pure,
    Or stolen garlands from a temple door—
  What prayers and vigils would I not endure,
    And weeping kiss the consecrated floor?

  Had I deserved this stroke,—with pious pain
    From shrine to shrine my suppliant knees should crawl;
  I would to all absolving gods complain,
    And smite my forehead on the marble wall.

  Thou who thy gibes at love canst scarce repress,
    Beware! The angry god may strike again!
  I knew a youth who laughed at love's distress,
   And bore, when old, the worst that lovers ken.

  His poor, thin voice he did compel to woo,
    And curled, for mockery, his scanty hair;
  Spied on her door, as slighted lovers do,
    And stopped her maid in any public square.

  The forum-loungers thrust him roughly by,
    And spat upon their breasts, such luck to turn:
  Have mercy, Venus! Thy true follower I!
    Why wouldst thou, goddess, thine own harvest burn!",Elegy
5,Tibullus,"I strove with wine my sorrows to efface.
    But wine turned tears was all the drink I knew;
  I tried a new, strange lass. Each cold embrace
    Brought my true love to mind, and colder grew.

  ""I was bewitched"" she cried ""by shameful charms;""
    And things most vile she vowed she could declare.
  Bewitched! 'tis true! but by thy soft white arms,
    Thy lovely brows and lavish golden hair!

  Such charms had Thetis, born in Nereid cave,
    Who drives  her  dolphin-chariot fast and free
  To Peleus o'er the smooth Hæmonian wave,
    Love-guided o'er long leagues of azure sea.

  Ah me! the magic that dissolves my health
    Is a rich suitor in my mistress' eye,
  Whom that vile bawd led to her door by stealth
    And opened it, and bade me pine and die.

  That hag should feed on blood. Her festive bowls
    Should be rank gall: and round her haunted room
  Wild, wailing ghosts and monitory owls
    Should flit forever shrieking death and doom.

  Made hunger-mad, may she devour the grass
    That grows on graves, and gnaw the bare bones down
  Which wolves have left! Stark-naked may she pass,
    Chased by the street-dogs through the taunting town!

  My curse comes fast. Unerring signs are seen
    In stars above us. There are gods who still
  Protect unhappy lovers: and our Queen
    Venus rains fire on all who slight her will.

  O cruel girl! unlearn the wicked art
    Of that rapacious hag! For everywhere
  Wealth murders love. But thy poor lover's heart
    Is ever thine, and thou his dearest care.

  A poor man clings close to thy lovely side,
    And keeps the crowd off, and thy pathway free;
  He hides thee with kind friends, and as his bride
    From thy dull, golden thraldom ransoms thee.

  Vain is my song. Her door will not unclose
    For words, but for a hand that knocks with gold.
  O fear me, my proud rival, fear thy foes!
    Oft have the wheels of fortune backward rolled!",Elegy
6,Tibullus,"Thou beckonest ever with a face all smiles,
    Then, God of Love, thou lookest fierce and pale.
  Unfeeling boy! why waste on me such wiles?
    What glory if a god o'er man prevails?

  Once more thy snares are set. My Delia flies
    To steal a night—with whom I cannot tell.
  Can I believe when she denies, denies—
    I, for whose sake she tricked her lord so well?

  By me, alas! those cunning ways were shown
    To fool her slaves. My skill I now deplore!
  For me she made excuse to sleep alone,
    Or silenced the shrill hinges of her door.

  ""Twas I prescribed what remedies to use
    If mutual passion somewhat fiercely play;
  If there were tell-tale bite or rosy bruise,
    I showed what simples take the scars away.

  Hear me! fond husband of the false and fair,
    Make me thy guest, and she shall chastely go!
  When she makes talk with men I shall take care,
    Nor shall she at the wine her bosom show.

  I shall take care she does not nod or smile
    To any other, nor her hand imbue
  With his fast-flowing wine, that her swift guile
    May scribble on the board their rendez-vous.

  When she goes out, beware! And if she hie
    To Bona Dea, where no males may be,
  Straight to the sacred altars follow I,
    Who only trust her if my eyes can see.

  Oh! oft I pressed that soft hand I adore,
    Feigning with some rare ring or seal to play,
  And plied thee with strong wine till thou didst snore,
    While I, with wine and water, won the day.

  I wronged thee, aye! But 'twas not what I meant.
    Forgive, for I confess. 'Twas Cupid's spell
  O'er-swayed me. Who can foil a god's intent?
    Now have I courage all my deeds to tell.

  Yes, it was I, unblushing I declare.
    At whom thy watch-dog all night long did bay:—
  But some-one else now stands insistent there,
    Or peers about him and then walks away.

  He seems to pass. But soon will backward fare
    Alone, and, coughing, at the threshold hide.
  What skill hath stolen love! Beware, beware!
    Thy boat is drifting on a treacherous tide.

  What worth a lovely wife, if others buy
    Thy treasure, if thy stoutest bolt betrays,
  If in thy very arms she breathes a sigh
    For absent joy, and feigns a slight malaise?

  Give her in charge to me! I will not spare
    A master's whip. Her chain shall constant be.
  While thou mayst go abroad and have no care
    Who trims his curls, or flaunts his toga free.

  Whatever beaux accost her, all is well!
    Not the least hint of scandal shall be made.
  For I will send them far away, to tell
    In some quite distant street their amorous trade.

  All this a god decrees; a sibyl wise
    In prophet-song did this to me proclaim;
  Who when Bellona kindles in her eyes,
    Fears neither twisted scourge nor scorching flame.

  Then with a battle-axe herself will scar
    Her own wild arms, and sprinkle on the ground
  Blood, for Bellona's emblems of wild war,
    Swift-flowing from the bosom's gaping wound.

  A barb of iron rankles in her breast,
    As thus she chants the god's command to all:
  ""Oh, spare a beauty by true love possessed,
    Lest some vast after-woe upon thee fall!

  ""For shouldst thou win her, all thy power will fail,
    As from this wound flows forth the fatal gore,
  Or as these ashes cast upon the gale,
    Are scattered far and kindled never more.""

  And, O my Delia, the fierce prophetess
    Told dreadful things that on thy head should fall:—
  I know not what they were—but none the less
    I pray my darling may escape them all.

  Not for thyself do I forgive thee, no!
    'Tis thy sweet mother all my wrath disarms,—
  That precious creature, who would come and go,
    And lead thee through the darkness to my arms.

  Though great the peril, oft the silent dame
    Would join our hands together, and all night
  Wait watching on the threshold till I came,
    Nor ever failed to know my steps aright.

  Long be thy life! dear, kind and faithful heart!
    Would it were possible my life's whole year
  Were at the friendly hearth-stone where thou art!
    'Tis for thy sake I hold thy daughter dear.

  Be what she will, she is not less thy child.
    Oh, teach her to be chaste! Though well she knows
  No free-born fillet binds her tresses wild
    Nor Roman stole around her ankles flows!

  My lot is servile too. Whate'er I see
    Of beauty brings her to my fevered eye.
  If I should be accused of crime, or be
    Dragged up the steep street, by the hair, to die:—

  Even then there were no fear that I should lay
    Rude hands on thee my sweet! for if o'erswayed
  By such blind frenzy in an evil day,
    I should bewail the hour my hands were made.

  Yet would I have thee chaste and constant be,
    Not with a fearful but a faithful heart;
  And that in thy fond breast the love of me
    Burn but more fondly when we live apart.

  She who was never faithful to a friend
    Will come to age and misery, and wind
  With tremulous ringer from her distaff's end
    The ever-twisting wool; and she will bind

  Upon her moving looms the finished thread,
    Or clean and pick the long skeins white as snow.
  And all her fickle gallants when they wed,
    Will say, ""That old one well deserves her woe.""

  Venus from heaven will note her flowing tear:
    ""I smile not on the faithless,"" she will say.
  Her curse on others fall! O, Delia dear!
    Let us teach true love to grow old and gray!",Elegy
7,Tibullus,"The Fatal Sisters did this day ordain,
  Reeling threads no god can rend,
  Foretelling to this man should bend
  The tribes of Acquitaine;
  And 'neath his legions' yoke
  Th' impetuous torrent Atur glide subdued.
  All was accomplished as the Fates bespoke;
  His triumph then ensued:
  The Roman youth, exulting from afar,
  Acclaimed his mighty deeds,
  And watched the fettered chieftains filing by,
  While, drawn by snow-white steeds,
  Messala followed on his ivory car,
  Laurelled and lifted high!

  Not without me this glory and renown!
  Let Pyrenees my boast attest!
  Tarbella, little mountain-town,
  Cold Ocean rolling in the utmost West,
  Arar, Garonne, and rushing Rhone,
  Will bear me witness due;
  And valleys broad the blond Carnutes own,
  By Liger darkly blue.
  I saw the Cydnus flow,
  Winding on in ever-tranquil mood,
  And from his awful peak, in cloud and snow,
  Cold Taurus o'er his wild Cilicians' brood.
  I saw through thronged streets unmolested flying
  Th' inviolate white dove of Palestine;
  I looked on Tyrian towers, by soundless waters lying,
  Whence Tyrians first were masters of the brine.
  The flooding Nile I knew;
  What time hot Sirius glows,
  And Egypt's thirsty field the covering deluge knows;
  But whence the wonder flows,
  O Father Nile! no mortal e'er did view.
  Along thy bank not any prayer is made
  To Jove for fruitful showers.
  On thee they call! Or in sepulchral shade,
  The life-reviving, sky-descended powers
  Of bright Osiris hail,—
  While, wildly chanting, the barbaric choir,
  With timbrels and strange fire,
  Their Memphian bull bewail.

  Osiris did the plough bestow,
  And first with iron urged the yielding ground.
  He taught mankind good seed to throw
  In furrows all untried;
  He plucked fair fruits the nameless trees did hide:
  He first the young vine to its trellis bound,
  And with his sounding sickle keen
  Shore off the tendrils green.

  For him the bursting clusters sweet
  Were in the wine-press trod;
  Song followed soon, a prompting of the god,
  And rhythmic dance of lightly leaping feet.
  Of Bacchus the o'er-wearied swain receives
  Deliverance from all his pains;
  Bacchus gives comfort when a mortal grieves,
  And mirth to men in chains.
  Not to Osiris toils and tears belong,
  But revels and delightful song;
  Lightly beckoning loves are thine!
  Garlands deck thee, god of wine!
  We hear thee coming, with the flute's refrain,
  With fruit of ivy on thy forehead bound,
  Thy saffron vesture streaming to the ground.
  And thou hast garments, too, of Tyrian stain,
  When thine ecstatic train
  Bear forth thy magic ark to mysteries divine.

  Immortal guest, our games and pageant share!
  Smile on the flowing cup, and hail
  With us the Genius of this natal day!
  From whose anointed, rose-entwisted hair,
  Arabian odors waft away.
  If thou the festal bless, I will not fail
  To burn sweet incense unto him and thee,
  And offerings of Arcadian honey bear.

  So grant Messala fortunes ever fair!
  Of such a sire the children worthy be!
  Till generations two and three
  Surround his venerated chair!
  See, winding upward through the Latin land,
  Yon highway past, the Alban citadel,
  At great Messala's mandate made,
  In fitted stones and firm-set gravel laid,
  Thy monument forever more to stand!
  The mountain-villager thy fame will tell,
  When through the darkness wending late from Rome,
  He foots it smoothly home.

  O Genius of this natal day,
  May many a year thy gift declare!
  Now bright and fair thy pinions soar away,—
  Return, thou bright and fair!",Elegy
8,Tibullus,"The language of a lover's eyes I cannot choose but see;
  The oracles in tender sighs were never dark to me.

  No art of augury I need, nor heart of victims slain,
  Nor birds of omen singing forth the future's bliss or bane.

  Venus herself did round my arm th' enchanted wimple throw,
  And taught me—Ah! not unchastised!—what wizardry I know.

  Deceive me then no more! The god more furiously burns
  Whatever wight rebelliously his first commandment spurns.
  Fair Pholoë! what profits it to plait thy flowing hair?
  Why rearrange each lustrous tress with fond, superfluous care?

  Why tint that blooming cheek anew? Or give thy fingers, Girl!
  To slaves who keep the dainty tips a perfect pink and pearl?

  Why strain thy sandal-string so hard? or why the daily change
  Of mantles, robes, and broideries, of fashions new and strange?

  Howe'er thou hurry from thy glass in careless disarray,
  Thou canst not miss the touch that steals thy lover's heart away!

  Thou needst not ask some wicked witch her potion to provide,
  Brewed of the livid, midnight herbs, to draw him to thy side.

  Her magic from a neighbor's field the coming crop can charm,
  Or stop the viper's lifted sting before it work thee harm.

  Such magic would the riding moon from her white chariot spill,
  Did not the brazen cymbals' sound undo the impious ill!

  But fear not thou thy smitten swain of lures and sorcery tell,
  Thy beauty his enchantment was, without inferior spell.

  To touch thy flesh, to taste thy kiss, his freedom did destroy;
  Thy beauteous body in his arms enslaved the hapless boy.

  Proud Pholoë! why so unkind, when thy young lover pleads?
  Remember Venus can avenge a fair one's heartless deeds!

  Nay, nay! no gifts! Go gather them of bald-heads rich and old!
  Ay! let them buy thy mocking smiles and languid kisses cold!

  Better than gold that youthful bloom of his round, ruddy face,
  And beardless lips that mar not thine, however close th' embrace.

  If thou above his shoulders broad thy lily arms entwine,
  The luxury of monarchs proud is mean compared with thine.

  May Venus teach thee how to yield to all thy lover's will,
  When blushing passion bursts its bounds and bids thy bosom thrill.

  Go, meet his dewy, lingering lips in many a breathless kiss!
  And let his white neck bear away rose-tokens of his bliss!

  What comfort, girl, can jewels bring, or gems in priceless store,
  To her who sleeps and weeps alone, of young love wooed no more?

  Too late, alas! for love's return, or fleeting youth's recall,
  When on thy head relentless age has cast the silvery pall.

  Then  beauty will  be  anxious  art,—to  tinge  the changing hair,
  And hide the record of the years with colors falsely fair.

  To pluck the silver forth, and with strange surgery and pain,
  Half-flay the fading cheek and brow, and bid them bloom again.

  O listen, Pholoë! with thee are youth and jocund May:
  Enjoy to-day! The golden hours are gliding fast away!

  Why plague our comely Marathus? Thy chaste severity
  Let wrinkled wooers feel,—but not, not such a youth as he!

  Spare the poor lad! 'tis not some crime his soul is brooding on;
  'Tis love of thee that makes his eyes so wild and woe-begone!

  He suffers! hark! he moans thy loss in many a doleful sigh,
  And from his eyes the glittering tears flow down and will not dry.

  ""Why say me nay?"" he cries, ""Why talk of chaperones severe?
  I am in love and know the art to trick a listening ear.""

  ""At stolen tryst and rendez-vous my breath is light and low,
  And I can give a kiss so soft not even the winds may know.

  ""I creep unheard at dead of night along a marble floor,
  ""Nor foot-fall make, nor tell-tale creak, when I unbar the door.

  ""What use are all my arts, if still my lady answers nay!
  ""If even to her couch I came, she'd frown and fly away!

  ""Or when she says she will, 'tis then she doth most treacherous prove,
  ""And keeps me tortured all night long with unrewarded love.

  ""And while I say 'She comes, she comes!' whatever breathes or stirs,
  ""I think I hear a footstep light of tripping feet like hers!

  ""Away vain arts of love! false aids to win the fair!
  ""Henceforth a cloak of filthy shag shall be my only wear!

  ""Her door is shut! She doth deny one moment's interview!
  ""I'll wear my toga loose no more, as happier lovers do.""

  Have done, dear lad! In vain thy tears! She will not heed thy plea!
  Redden no more thy bright young eyes to please her cruelty!

  I warn thee, Pholoë, when the gods chastise thy naughty pride,
  No incense burned at holy shrines will turn their wrath aside.

  This Marathus himself, erewhile, made mock of lovers' moan,
  Nor knew how soon the vengeful god would mark him for his own.

  He also laughed at sighs and tears, and oft would make delay,
  And oft a lover's fondest wish would baffle and betray.

  But now on beauty's haughty ways he looks in fierce disdain;
  He scarce may pass a bolted door without a secret pain.

  Beware, proud girl, some plague will fall, unless thy pride give way;
  Thou wilt in vain the gods implore to send thee back this day!
",Elegy
9,Tibullus,"Why, if my sighs thou wert so soon to scorn,
    Didst dare on Heaven with perjured promise call?
  Ah! not unpunished can men be forsworn;
    Silent and slow the perjurer's doom shall fall.

  Ye gods, be merciful! Oh! let it be
    That beauteous creatures who for once offend
  Your powers divine, for once may go scot-free,
    Escape your scourge, and make some happy end!

  'Tis love of gold binds oxen to the plough,
    And bids their goading driver sweat and chide;
  The quest of gold allures the ship's frail prow
    O'er wind-swept seas, where stars the wanderers guide.

  By golden gifts my love was made a slave.
    Oh, that some god a lover's prayer might hear,
  And sink such gifts in ashes of a grave,
    Or bid them in swift waters disappear!

  But I shall be avenged. Thy lovely grace
    The dust of weary exile will impair;
  Fierce, parching suns will mar thy tender face,
    And rude winds rough thy curls and clustering hair.

  Did I not warn thee never to defile
    Beauty with gold? For every wise man knows
  That riches only mantle with a smile
    A thousand sorrows and a host of woes.

  If snared by wealth, thou dost at love blaspheme,
    Venus will frown so on thy guilty deed,
  'Twere better to be burned or stabbed, I deem,
    Or lashed with twisted scourge till one should bleed.

  Hope not to cover it! That god will come
    Who lets not mortal secrets safely hide;
  That god who bids our slaves be deaf and dumb,
    Then, in their cups, the scandal publish wide.

  This god from men asleep compels the cry
    That shouts aloud the thing they last would tell.
  How oft with tears I told thee this, when I
    At thy white feet a shameful suppliant fell!

  Then wouldst thou vow that never glittering gold
    Nor jewels rare could turn thine eyes from me,
  Nor all the wealth Campania's acres hold,
    Nor full Falernian vintage flowing free.

  For oaths like thine I would have sworn the skies
    Hold not a star, nor crystal streams look clear:
  While thou wouldst weep, and I, unskilled in lies,
    Wiped from thy lovely blush the trickling tear.

  Why didst thou so? save that thy fancy strayed
    To beauty fickle as thine own and light?
  I let thee go. Myself the torches made,
    And kept thy secret for a live-long night.

  Sometimes I led to sudden rendezvous
    The flattered object of thy roving joys.
  Mad that I was! Till now I never knew
    How love like thine ensnares and then destroyes.

  With wondering mind I versified thy praise;
    But now that Muse with blushes I requite.
  May some swift fire consume my moon-struck lays,
    Or flooding rivers drown them out of sight!

  And thou, O thou whose beauty is a trade,
    Begone, begone! Thy gains bring cursed ill.
  And thou, whose gifts my frail and fair betrayed,
    May thy wife rival thine adulterous skill!

  Languid with stolen kisses, may she frown,
    And chastely to thy lips drop down her veil!
  May thy proud house be common to the town,
    And many a gallant at thy bed prevail!

  Nor let thy gamesome sister e'er be said
    To drain more wine-cups than her lovers be,
  Though oft with wine and rose her feast is red
    Till the bright wheels of morn her revels see!

  No one like her to pass a furious night
    In varied vices and voluptuous art!
  Well did she train thy wife, who fools thee quite,
    And clasps, with practised passion, to her heart!

  Is it for thee she binds her beauteous hair,
    Or in long toilets combs each dainty tress?
  For thee, that golden armlet rich and rare,
    Or Tyrian robes that her soft bosom press?

  Nay, not for thee! some lover young and trim
    Compels her passion to allure his flame
  By all the arts of beauty. 'Tis for him
    She wastes thy wealth and brings thy house to shame.

  I praise her for it. What nice girl could bear
    Thy gouty body and old dotard smile?
  Yet unto thee did my lost love repair—
    O Venus! a wild beast were not so vile!

  Didst thou make traffic of my fond caress,
    And with another mock my kiss for gain?
  Go, weep! Another shall my heart possess,
    And sway the kingdom where thou once didst reign.

  Go, weep! But I shall laugh. At Venus' door
    I hang a wreath of palm enwrought with gold;
  And graven on that garland evermore,
    Her votaries shall read this story told:

""Tibullus, from a lying love set free,
O Goddess, brings his gift, and asks new grace of thee.""",Elegy
10,Tibullus,"Whoe'er first forged the terror-striking sword,
  His own fierce heart had tempered like its blade.
  What slaughter followed! Ah! what conflict wild!
  What swifter journeys unto darksome death!
  But blame not him! Ourselves have madly turned
  On one another's breasts that cunning edge
  Wherewith he meant mere blood of beast to spill.

  Gold makes our crime. No need for plundering war,
  When bowls of beech-wood held the frugal feast.
  No citadel was seen nor moated wall;
  The shepherd chief led home his motley flock,
  And slumbered free from care. Would I had lived
  In that good, golden time; nor e'er had known
  A mob in arms arrayed; nor felt my heart
  Throb to the trumpet's call! Now to the wars
  I must away, where haply some chance foe
  Bears now the blade my naked side shall feel.
  Save me, dear Lares of my hearth and home!
  Ye oft my childish steps did guard and bless,
  As timidly beneath your seat they strayed.

  Deem it no shame that hewn of ancient oak
  Your simple emblems in my dwelling stand!
  For so the pious generations gone
  Revered your powers, and with offerings rude
  To rough-hewn gods in narrow-built abodes,
  Lived beautiful and honorable lives.
  Did they not bring to crown your hallowed brows
  Garlands of ripest corn, or pour new wine
  In pure libation on the thirsty ground?
  Oft on some votive day the father brought
  The consecrated loaf, and close behind
  His little daughter in her virgin palm
  Bore honey bright as gold. O powers benign!
  To ye once more a faithful servant prays
  For safety! Let the deadly brazen spear
  Pass harmless o'er my head! and I will slay
  For sacrifice, with many a thankful song,
  A swine and all her brood, while I, the priest,
  Bearing the votive basket myrtle-bound,
  Walk clothed in white, with myrtle in my hair.

  Grant me but this! and he who can may prove
  Mighty in arms and by the grace of Mars
  Lay chieftains low; and let him tell the tale
  To me who drink his health, while on the board
  His wine-dipped finger draws, line after line,
  Just how his trenches ranged! What madness dire
  Bids men go foraging for death in war?
  Our death is always near, and hour by hour,
  With soundless step a little nearer draws.

  What harvest down below, or vineyard green?
  There Cerberus howls, and o'er the Stygian flood
  The dark ship goes; while on the clouded shore
  With hollow cheek and tresses lustreless,
  Wanders the ghostly throng. O happier far
  Some white-haired sire, among his children dear,
  Beneath a lowly thatch! His sturdy son
  Shepherds the young rams; he, his gentle ewes;
  And oft at eve, his willing labor done,
  His careful wife his weary limbs will bathe
  From a full, steaming bowl. Such lot be mine!
  So let this head grow gray, while I shall tell,
  Repeating oft, the deeds of long ago!
  Then may long Peace my country's harvests bless!
  Till then, let Peace on all our fields abide!
  Bright-vestured Peace, who first beneath their yoke
  Led oxen in the plough, who first the vine
  Did nourish tenderly, and chose good grapes,
  That rare old wine may pass from sire to son!
  Peace! who doth keep the plow and harrow bright,
  While rust on some forgotten shelf devours
  The cruel soldier's useless sword and shield.
  From peaceful holiday with mirth and wine
  The rustic, not half sober, driveth home
  With wife and weans upon the lumbering wain.

  But wars by Venus kindled ne'er have done;
  The vanquished lass, with tresses rudely torn,
  Of doors broke down, and smitten cheek complains;
  And he, her victor-lover, weeps to see
  How strong were his wild hands. But mocking Love
  Teaches more angry words, and while they rave,
  Sits with a smile between! O heart of stone!
  O iron heart! that could thy sweetheart strike!
  Ye gods avenge her! Is it not enough
  To tear her soft robe from her limbs away,
  And loose her knotted hair?—Enough, indeed,
  To move her tears! Thrice happy is the wight
  Whose frown some lovely mistress weeps to see!
  But he who gives her blows!—Go, let him bear
  A sword and spear! In exile let him be
  From Venus' mild domain! Come blessed Peace!
  Come, holding forth thy blade of ripened corn!
  Fill thy large lap with mellow fruits and fair!",Elegy
11,Tibullus,"Give us good omen, friends! To-day we bless
  With hallowed rites this dear, ancestral seat.
  Let Bacchus his twin horns with clusters dress,
  And Ceres clasp her brows with bursting wheat!

  To-day no furrows! Both for field and man
  Be sacred rest from delving toil and care!
  With necks yoke-free, at mangers full of bran,
  The tranquil steers shall nought but garlands bear.

  Our tasks to-day are heaven's. No maid shall dare
  Upon a distaff her deft hands employ.
  Let none, too rash, our simple worship share,
  Who wrought last eve at Venus' fleeting joy!

  The gods claim chastity. Come clad in white,
  And lave your palms at some clear fountain's brim!
  Then watch the mild lamb at the altar bright,
  Yon olive-cinctured choir close-following him!

  ""Ye Guardian Powers, who bless our native soil,
  Far from these acres keep ill luck away!
  No withered ears the reaper's task to spoil!
  Nor swift wolf on our laggard lambs to prey!""

  So shall the master of this happy house
  Pile the huge logs upon his blazing floor;
  While with kind mirth and neighborly carouse,
  His bondsmen build their huts beside his door.

  The bliss I pray for has been granted me!
  With reverent art observing things divine,
  I have explored the omens,—and I see
  The Guardian Powers are good to me and mine.

  Bring old Falernian from the shadows gray,
  And burst my Chian seal! He is disgraced,
  Who gets home sober from this festive day,
  Or finds his door without a step retraced.

  Health to Messala now from all our band!
  Drink to each letter of his noble name!
  Messala! laurelled from the Gallic land,
  Of his grim-bearded sires the last, best fame!

  Be with me, thou! inspire a song for me
  To sing those gods of woodland, hill and glade,
  Without whose arts man's hunger still would be
  Only on mast and gathered acorns stayed.

  They taught us rough-hewn rafters to prepare,
  And clothe low cabins with a roof of green;
  They bade fierce bulls the servile yoke to bear;
  And wheels to move a wain were theirs, I ween.

  Our wild fruit was forgot, when apple-boughs
  Bore grafts, and thirsty orchards (art divine!)
  Were freshed by ditching; while with sweet carouse
  The wine-press flowed, and water wed with wine.

  Our fields bore harvests, when the dog-star flame
  Bade Summer of her tawny tress be shorn;
  From fields of Spring the bees, with busy game,
  Stored well their frugal combs the live-long morn.

  'Twas some field-tiller from his plough at rest,
  First hummed his homely words to numbers true,
  Or trilled his pipe of straw in songs addressed
  To his blithe woodland gods, with worship due.

  Some rustic ruddied with vermilion clay
  First led, O Bacchus, thy swift choric throng,
  And won for record of thy festal day
  Some fold's chief goat, fit meed of frolic song!

  It was our rustic boys whose virgin band
  New coronals of Spring's sweet flowrets made
  For offering to the gods who bless our land,
  Which on the Lares' hallowed heads were laid.

  Our country-lasses find a pleasing care
  In soft, warm wool their snowy flocks have bred;
  The distaff, skein and spindle they prepare,
  And reel, with firm-set thumb, the faultless thread.

  Then following Minerva's heavenly art,
  They weave with patient toil some fabric proud;
  While at her loom the lass with cheerful heart
  Sings songs the sounding shuttle answers loud.

  Cupid himself with flocks and herds did pass
  His boyhood, and on sheep and horses drew
  His erring infant bow; but now, alas!
  He is an archer far too swift and true.

  Not now dull beasts, but luckless maids engage
  His enmity; brave men are brave no more;
  Youth's strength he wastes, and drives fond, foolish age
  To blush and sigh at scornful beauty's door.

  Love-lured, the virgin, guarded and discreet,
  Slips by the night-watch at her lover's call,
  Feels the dark path-way with her trembling feet,
  And gropes with out-spread hands along the wall.

  Oh! wretched are the wights this god would harm!
  But blest as gods whom Love with smiles will sway!
  Come, boy divine! and these dear revels charm—
  But fling thy burning brands, far, far away!

  Sing to this god, sweet shepherds! Ask aloud
  Your flocks' good health; then each, discreetly mute,
  His love's!—Nay, scream her name! Yon madcap crowd
  Screams louder, to its wry-necked Phrygian flute.

  On with the sport! Night's chariot appears:
  The stars, her children, follow through the sky:
  Dark Sleep comes soon, on wings no mortal hears,
  With strange, dim dreams that know not where they fly.",Elegy
12,Tibullus,"Burn incense now! and round our altars fair
    With cheerful vows or sacred silence stand!
  To-day Cerinthus' birth our rites declare,
    With perfumes from the blest Arabian land.

  Let his own Genius to our festal haste,
    While fresh-blown flowers his heavenly tresses twine
  And balm-anointed brows; so let him taste
    Our offered loaf and sweet, unstinted wine!

  To thee Cerinthus may his favoring care
    Grant every wish! O claim some priceless meed!
  Ask a fond wife thy life-long bliss to share—
    Nay! This the great gods have long since decreed!

  Less than this gift were lordship of wide fields,
    Where slow-paced yoke and swain compel the corn;
  Less, all rich gems the womb of India yields,
    Where the flushed Ocean rims the shores of Morn.

  Thy vow is granted! Lo! on pinions bright,
    The Love-god comes, a yellow cincture bearing,
  To bind thee ever to thy dear delight,
    In nuptial knot, all other knots outwearing.

  When wrinkles delve, and o'er the reverend brow
    Fall silver locks and few, the bond shall be
  But more endeared; and thou shall bless this vow
    O'er children's children smiling at thy knee.",Elegy
13,Tibullus,"To pleasures of the country-side
    My lady-love is lightly flown;
  And now in cities to abide
    Betrays a heart of stone.

  Venus herself henceforth will choose
    Only in field and farm to walk,
  And Cupid but the language use
    Which plough-boy lovers talk.

  O what a ploughman I could be!
    How deep the furrows I would trace,
  If while I toiled, I might but see
    My mistress' smiling face!

  A farmer true, I'd guide my team
    Of barren steers o'er fruitful lands,
  Nor murmur at the noon-day beam,
    Or my soft, blistered hands.

  Once fair Apollo fed the flocks
    Of King Admetus, like a swain;
  Little availed his flowing locks,
    His lyre was little gain.

  No virtuous herb to reach that ill
    His heavenly arts of healing knew;
  For love made vain his famous skill,
    And all his art o'er-threw.

  Himself his herds afield he drove,
    Or where the cooling waters stray;
  Himself the willow baskets wove,
    And strained out curds and whey.

  Oft would his heavenly shoulders bear
    A calf adown some pathless place;
  And oft Diana met him there,
    And blushed at his disgrace.

  O often, if his voice divine
    Echoed the mountain glens along,
  Out-burst the loud, audacious kine,
    And bellowing drowned his song.

  His tripods prince and people found
    All silent to their troubled cry,
  His locks dishevelled and unbound
    Woke fond Latona's sigh.

  To see his pale, neglected brow,
    And unkempt tresses, once so fair,—
  They cried, ""O where is Phoebus now?
    ""His glorious tresses, where?""

  ""In place of Delos' golden fane,
    ""Love gives thee but a lowly shed!
  ""O, where are Delphi and its train?
    ""The Sibyl, whither fled?""

  Happy the days, forever flown,
    When even immortal gods could dare
  Proudly to serve at Venus' throne,
    Nor blushed her chain to wear!

  ""Irreverent fables!"" I am told.
    But lovers true these tales receive:
  Rather a thousand such they hold,
    Than loveless gods believe.

  O Ceres, who didst charm away
    My Nemesis from life in Rome,
  May barren glebe thy pains repay
    And scanty harvest come!

  A curse upon thy merry trade!
    Young Bacchus, giver of the vine!
  Thy vine-yards have ensnared a maid
    Far sweeter than thy wine.

  Let herbs and acorns be our meat!
    Drink good old water! Better so
  Than that my fickle beauty's feet
    To those far hills should go!

  Did not our sires on acorns feed,
    And love-sick rove o'er hill and dale?
  Our furrowed fields they did not need,
    Nor did love's harvest fail.

  When passion did their hearts employ,
    And o'er them breathed the blissful hour,
  Mild Venus freely found them joy
    In every leafy bower.

  No chaperone was there, no door
    Against a lover's sighs to stand.
  Delicious age! May Heaven restore
    Its customs to our land!

  Nay, take me! In my lady's train
    Some stubborn field I fain would plough
  Lay on the lash and clamp the chain!
    I bear them meekly now.",Elegy
14,Tibullus,"A woman's slave am I, and know it well.
    Farewell, my birthright! farewell, liberty!
  In wretched slavery and chains I dwell,
    For love's sad captives never are set free.

  Whether I smile or curse, love just the same
    Brands me and burns. O, cruel woman, spare!
  O would I were a rock, to 'scape this flame
    Far off upon the frosty mountains there!

  Would I were flint, to front the tempest's power,
    Wave-buffeted on some wild, wreckful shore!
  My sad days bring worse nights, and every hour
    Fills me some cup of gall and brims it o'er.

  What use are songs? Her greedy hands disdain
    Apollo's gift. She says some gold is due.
  Farewell, ye Muses, I have sung in vain!
    Only in quest of her I followed you.

  I sing no wars; nor how the moon and sun
    In heavenly paths their circling chariots steer.
  To win my lady's smiles my numbers run;
    Farewell, ye Muses, if ye fail me here!

  Let deeds of bloody crime now make me bold!
    No longer at her bolted door I whine;
  But I will find that necessary gold,
    Though I steal treasure from some holy shrine.

  Venus I first will violate; for she
    Compelled my crime, and did my heart enthrall
  To beauty that requires a golden fee.
    Yes, Venus' shrine shall suffer worst of all.

  Curse on that man who finds the emerald green,
    And Tyrian purples for our flattered girls!
  He makes them greedy. Now they must be seen
    In Coan robe and gleaming Red Sea pearls.

  It spoils them all. Now bolts and barriers hold
   Their doors, and watch-dogs threaten through the dark;
  But let the lover overflow with gold,—
    All bolts fly back and not a dog will bark.

  What God did beauty unto gold degrade,
    And mix one bliss with many a woe and shame?
  Tears, quarrels, curses were the gifts he made;
    And Love bears now a very evil name.

  False girl, who dost for riches thrust aside
    Love's honest vow, may winds and flames conspire
  To wreck thy wealth, while all thy beaux deride
    The loss, nor throw one bowl-full on the fire!

  O when dark Death shall be thy final guest,
    No lover true will shed the faithful tear,
  Nor bring an offering where thy ashes rest,
    Nor lay one garland on thy lonely bier I

  But some warm-hearted lass who loved not gain
    Shall live a hundred years, yet be much mourned;
  Her tomb shall be some lover's holiest fane,
    With annual gift of all sad flowers adorned.

  ""Farewell, true heart!"" his trembling lips will say,
    ""Let peace untroubled bless thy relics dear!""
  Oft will he visit, and departing pray,
    ""Light lie this earth on her whose rest is here!""

  Nay, it is vain such serious songs to breathe:
    I must be modern, if I would prevail.
  How much? Just all my ancestors bequeath?
    Come, Lares! You are advertised for sale.

  Let Circe and Medea bring the lees
    Of some foul cup! Let Thessaly prepare
  Its direst poison! Bring hippomanes,
    Fierce philtre from the frantic, brooding mare!
  For if my mistress mix it with a smile,
  I drain a draught a thousand times as vile.",Elegy
15,Tibullus,"Smile, Phoebus, on the youthful priest
  Who seeks thy shrine to-day!
  With lyre and song attend our feast,
  And with imperious finger play
  Thy loudly thrilling chords to anthems high!
  Come, with temples laurel-bound,
  O'er thine own thrice-hallowed ground,
  Where incense from our altars meets the sky!
  Come radiant and fair,
  In golden garb and glorious, clustering hair,
  The famous guise in which thou sang'st so well
  Of victor Jove, when Saturn's kingdom fell!
  The far-off future all is thine!
  Thy hallowed augurs can divine
  Whate'er dark song the birds of omen sing;
  Of augury thou art the king,
  And thy wise haruspex finds meaning fit
  For what the gods have in the victims writ.
  The hoary Sibyl taught of thee
  Never sings of Rome untrue,
  Chanting forth in measures due
  Her mysterious prophecy.

  Once she bade Aeneas look
  In her all-revealing book,
  What time from Trojan shore
  His father and his fallen gods he bore.
  Doubtful and dark to him was Rome's bright name,
  While yet his mournful eyes
  Saw Ilium dying and her gods in flame.
  Not yet beneath the skies
  Had Romulus upreared the weight
  Of our Eternal City's wall,
  Denied to Remus by unequal fate.
  Then lowly cabins small
  Possessed the seat of Capitolian Jove;
  And, over Palatine, the rustics drove
  Their herds afield, where Pan's similitude
  Dripped down with milk beneath an ilex tall,
  And Pales' image rude
  Hewn out by pruning-hook, for worship stood.
  The shepherd hung upon the bough
  His babbling pipes in payment of a vow,—
  The pipe of reeds in lessening order placed,
  Knit well with wax from longest unto last.
  Where proud Velabrum lies,
  A little skiff across the shallows plies;
  And oft, to meet her shepherd lover,
  The village lass is ferried over
  For a woodland holiday:
  At night returning o'er the watery way,
  She brings a tribute from the fruitful farms—
  A cheese, or white lamb, carried in her arms.
  ""High-souled Aeneas, brother of light-winged Love,
  ""Thy pilgrim ships Troy's fallen worship bear.
  ""To thee the Latin lands are given of Jove,
  ""And thy far-wandering gods are welcome there.
  ""Thou thyself shalt have a shrine
  ""By Numicus' holy wave;
  ""Be thou its genius strong to bless and save,
  ""By power divine!

  ""O'er thy ship's storm-beaten prow
  ""Victory her wings will spread,
  ""And, glorious, rest at last above a Trojan head.
  ""I see Rutulia flaming round me now.
  ""O barbarous Turnus, I behold thee dead!
  ""Laurentum rushes on my sight,
  ""And proud Lavinium's castled height,
  ""And Alba Longa for thy royal heir.
  ""Now I see a priestess fair
  ""Close in Mars' divine embrace.
  ""Daughter of Ilium, she fled away
  ""From Vesta's fires, and from her virgin face
  ""The fillet dropped, and quite unheeded lay;
  ""Nor shield nor corslet then her hero wore,
  ""Keeping their stolen tryst by Tiber's sacred shore!
  ""Browse, ye bulls, along the seven green hills!
  ""For yet a little while ye may,
  ""E'er the vast city shall confront the day!
  ""O Rome! thy destined glory fills
  ""A wide world subject to thy sway,—
  ""Wide as all the regions given
  ""To fruitful Ceres, as she looks from heaven
  ""O'er her fields of golden corn,
  ""From the opening gates of morn
  ""To where the Sun in Ocean's billowy stream
  ""Cools at eve his spent and panting team.
  ""Troy herself at last shall praise
  ""Thee and thy far-wandering ways.
  ""My song is truth. Thus only I endure
  ""The bitter laurel-leaf divine,
  ""And keep me at Apollo's shrine
  ""A virgin ever pure.""

  So, Phoebus, in thy name the Sibyl sung,
  As o'er her frenzied brow her loosened locks she flung.

  In equal song Herophile
  Chanted forth the times to be,
  From her cold Marpesian glade.
  Amalthea, dauntless maid,
  In the blessed days gone by,
  Bore thy book through Anio's river
  And did thy prophecies deliver,
  From her mantle, safe and dry.

  All prophesied of omens dire,
  The comet's monitory fire,
  Stones raining down, and tumult in the sky
  Of trumpets, swords, and routed chivalry;
  The very forests whispered fear,
  And through the stormful year
  Tears, burning tears, from marble altars ran;
  Dumb beast took voice to tell the fate of man;
  The Sun himself in light did fail
  As if he yoked his car to horses mortal-pale.

  Such was the olden time. O Phoebus, now
  Of mild, benignant brow,
  Let those portents buried be
  In the wild, unfathomed sea!
  Now let thy laurel loudly flame
  On altars to thy gracious name,
  And give good omen of a fruitful year
  Crackling laurel if the rustic hear,
  He knows his granary shall bursting be,
  And sweet new wine flow free,
  And purple grapes by jolly feet be trod,
  Vat and cellar will be too small,
  While at the vintage-festival,
  With choral song,
  The tipsy swains carouse the shepherd's god:
  ""Away, ye wolves, and do our folds no wrong!""

  Then shall the master touch the straw-built fire,
  And as it blazes high and higher,
  Lightly leap its lucky crest.
  A welcome heir with frolic face
  Shall his jovial sire embrace,
  And kiss him hard and pull him by the ears;
  While o'er the cradle the good grand-sire bent
  Will babble with the babe in equal merriment,
  And feel no more his weight of years.

  There in soft shadow of some ancient tree,
  Maidens, boys, and wine-cups be,
  Scattered on the pleasant grass;
  From lip to lip the cups they pass;
  Their own mantles garland-bound
  Hang o'er-head for canopy,
  And every cup with rose is crowned;
  Each at banquet buildeth high
  Of turf the table, and of turf the bed,—
  Such was ancient revelry!
  Here too some lover at his darling's head
  Flings words of scorn, which by and by
  He wildly prays be left unsaid,
  And swears that wine-cups lie.

  O under Phoebus' ever-peaceful sway,
  Away, ye bows, ye arrows fierce, away!
  Let Love without a shaft among earth's peoples stray!
  A noble weapon! but when Cupid takes
  His arrow,—ah! what mortal wound he makes!
  Mine is the chief. This whole year have I lain
  Wounded to death, yet cherishing the pain,
  And counting my delicious anguish gain.
  Of Nemesis my song must tell!
  Without her name I make no verses well,
  My metres limp and all fine words are vain!

  Therefore, my darling, since the powers on high
  Protect the poets,—O! a little while
  On Apollo's servant smile!
  So let me sing in words divine
  An ode of triumph for young Messaline.
  Before his chariot he shall bear
  Towns and towers for trophies proud,
  And on his brow the laurel-garland wear;
  While, with woodland laurel crowned.
  His legions follow him acclaiming loud,
  ""Io triumphe,"" with far-echoing sound.

  Let my Messala of the festive crowd
  Receive applause, and joyfully behold
  His son's victorious chariot passing by!

  Smile, Phoebus there! Thy flowing locks all gold!
  Thy virgin sister, too, stoop with thee from the sky!
",Elegy
16,Tibullus,"Now for a soldier Macer goes. Will Cupid take the field?
  Will Love himself enlist, and bear on his soft breast a shield?

  Through weary marches over land, through wandering waves at sea,
  Armed cap-a-pie, will that small god the hero's comrade be?

  O burn him, boy, I pray, that could thy blessed favors slight!
  Back to the ranks the straggler bring beneath thy standard bright!

  Yet, if to soldiers thou art kind, I too will volunteer,
  I too will from a helmet drink, nor thirst in desert's fear.

  Venus, good-bye! Now, off I go! Good-bye, sweet ladies all!
  I am all valor, and delight to hear the trumpets call.

  Large is my brag! But while with pride my project I recite,
  I see her bolted door,—and then my boasting fails me quite.

  Never to visit her again, with many an oath I swore;
  But while I vowed, my feet had run unguided to her door.

  Come now, ye lovers all! who serve in Cupid's hard campaign,
  Let us together to the wars, and thus our peace regain!

  This age of iron frowns on love and smiles on golden gain,—
  On spoils of war which must be won by agony and pain.

  For spoils alone our swords are keen, and deadly spears are hurled
  While carnage, wrath, and swifter death fly broadcast through the world.

  For spoils, with double risk of death the threatening seas we sail,
  And climb the steel-beaked ship-of-war, so mighty and so frail!

  The spoilers proud to boundless lands their bloody titles read,
  And see innumerable flocks o'er endless acres feed

  Fine foreign marbles they will bring; and all the city stare,
  While one tall column for a house a thousand oxen bear.

  They bind with bars the tameless sea; behind a rampart proud
  Their little fishes swim in calm, when wintry storms are loud.

  Ah! Love! Will not a Samian bowl hold all our mirth and wine?
  And pottery of poor Cuman clay, with love, seem fair and fine?

  Nay! Woe is me! Naught now but gold can please our ladies gay;
  And so, since Venus asks for wealth, the spoils of war must pay.

  My Nemesis shall roll in wealth; and promenade the town,
  All glittering, with my golden gifts upon her gorgeous gown.

  Her filmy web of Coan weave with golden broidery gleams;
  Her swarthy slaves the Indian sun touched with its burning beams.

  In rival hues to make her fair all conquered regions vie,
  Afric its azure must bestow, and Tyre its purple dye.

  O look—I tell what all men know—on that most favored lover!
  Once in the market-place he sat, with both his soles chalked over.",Elegy
17,Tibullus,"Now the month of Mars beginning brings the merry season near,
  By our fathers named and numbered as the threshold of the year.
  Faithfully their custom keeping, through the wide streets to and fro,
  Offered at each friendly dwelling, seasonable gifts must go.
  O what gifts, Pierian Muses, may acceptably be poured
  On my own adored Neaera?—or, if not my own, adored!

  Song is love's best gift to beauty; gold but tempts the venal soul;
  Therefore, 'tis a song I send her on this amateurish scroll.
  Wind a page of saffron parchment round the white papyrus there,
  Polish well with careful pumice every silvery margin fair:

  On the dainty little cover, for a title to the same
  Let her bright eyes read the blazon of a love-sick poet's name.
  Let the pair of horn-tipped handles be embossed with colors gay,
  For my book must make a toilet, must put on its best array.

  By Castalia's whispering shadow, by Pieria's vocal spring,
  By yourselves, O listening Muses, who did prompt the song I sing,—
  Fly, I pray you, to her chamber, and my pretty booklet bear,
  All unmarred and perfect give it, every color fresh and fair:
  Let her send you back, confessing, if our hearts together burn;
  Or, if she but loves me little, or will nevermore return.
  Utter first, for she deserves it, many a golden wish and vow;
  Then deliver this true message, humbly, as I speak it now.

  'Tis a gift, O chaste Neaera, from thy husband yet to be.
  Take the trifle, though a ""brother"" now is all he seems to thee.

  He will swear he loves thee dearer than the blood in all his veins;
  Whether husband, or if only that cold ""sister"" name remains.
  Ah! but ""wife"" he calls it: nothing takes this sweet hope from his soul!
  Till a hapless ghost he wanders where the Stygian waters roll.",Elegy
18,Tibullus,"Whoe'er from darling bride her husband dear
    First forced to part, had but a heart of stone;
  And not less hard the man who could appear
    To bear such loss and live unloved, alone.

  I am but weak in this; such fortitude
    My soul has not; grief breaks my spirit quite.
  I shame not to declare it is my mood
    To sicken of a life such sorrows smite.

  When I shall journey to the shadowy land,
    And over my white bones black ashes be,
  Beside my pyre let fair Neaera stand,
    With long, loose locks unbound, lamenting me.

  Let her dear mother's grief with hers have share,
    One mourn a husband, one a son bewail!
  Then call upon my ghost with holy prayer,
    And pour ablution o'er their fingers pale.

  The white bones, which my body's wreck outlast,
    Girdled in flowing black they will upbear,
  Sprinkle with rare, old wine, and gently cast
    In bath of snowy milk, with pious care.

  These will they swathe with linen mantles o'er,
    And lay unmouldering in their marble bed;
  Then gift of Arab or Panchaian shore,
    Assyrian balm and Orient incense shed.

  And may they o'er my tomb the gift disburse
    Of faithful tears, remembering him below;
  For those cold ashes I have made this verse,
    That all my doleful way of death may know.

  My oft-frequented grave the words shall bear,
    And all who pass will read with pitying eyes:—
  ""Here Lygdamus, consumed with grief and care
""For his lost bride Neaera, hapless lies.""",Elegy
19,Tibullus,"'Tis vain to plague the skies with eager prayer,
    And offer incense with thy votive song,
  If only thou dost ask for marbles fair,
    To deck thy palace for the gazing throng.

  Not wider fields my oxen to employ,
    Nor flowing harvests and abundant land,
  I ask of heaven; but for a long life's joy
    With thee, and in old age to clasp thy hand.

  If when my season of sweet light is o'er,
    I, carrying nothing, unto Charon yield,
  What profits me a ponderous golden store,
    Or that a thousand yoke must plough my field?

  What if proud Phrygian columns fill my halls,
    Taenarian, Carystian, and the rest,
  Or branching groves adorn my spacious walls,
    Or golden roof, or floor with marbles dressed?

  What pleasure in rare Erythraean dyes,
    Or purple pride of Sidon and of Tyre,
  Or all that can solicit envious eyes,
    And which the mob of fools so well admire?

  Wealth has no power to lift life's load of care,
    Or free man's lot from Fortune's fatal chain;
  With thee, Neaera, poverty looks fair,
    And lacking thee, a kingdom were in vain.

  O golden day that shall at last restore
    My lost love to my arms! O blest indeed,
  And worthy to be hallowed evermore!
    May some kind god my long petition heed!

  No! not dominion, nor Pactolian stream,
    Nor all the riches the wide world can give!
  These other men may ask. My fondest dream
    Is, poor but free, with my true wife to live.

  Saturnian Juno, to all nuptials kind,
    Receive with grace my ever-anxious vow!
  Come, Venus, wafted by the Cyprian wind,
    And from thy car of shell smile on me now!

  But if the mournful sisters, by whose hands
    Our threads of life are spun, refuse me all—
  May Pluto bid me to his dreary lands,
    Where those wide rivers through the darkness fall!",Elegy
20,Tibullus,"Be kinder, gods! Let not the dreams come true
    Which last night's cruel slumber bade believe!
  Begone! your vain, delusive spells undo,
    Nor ask me to receive!

  The gods tell truth. With truth the Tuscan seer
    In entrails dark a book of fate may find;
  But dreams are folly and with fruitless fear
    Address the trembling mind.

  Although mankind, against night's dark surprise
    With sprinkled meal or salt ward off the ill,
  And often turn deaf ear to prophets wise,
    While dreams deceive them still;—

  May bright Lucina my foreboding mind
    From such vain terrors of the night redeem,
  For in my soul no deed of guilt I find,
    Nor do my lips blaspheme.

  Now had the Night upon her ebon wain
    Passed o'er the upper sky, and dipped a wheel
  In the blue sea: but Sleep, the friend of pain,
    Refused my sense to seal.

  Sleep stands defeated at the house of care:
    And only when from purpled orient skies
  Peered Phoebus forth, did tardy slumber bear
    Down on my weary eyes.

  Then seemed a youth with holy laurel crowned
    To fill my door: a wight so wondrous rare
  Was not in all the vanished ages found.
    No marble half so fair!

  Adown his neck, with myrtle-buds inwove
    And Syrian dews, his unshorn tresses flow:
  White is he as the moon in heaven above,
    But rose is blent with snow.

  Like that soft blush on face of virgin fair
    Led to her husband; or as maidens twine
  Lilies in amaranth; or Autumn's air
    Tinges the apples fine.

  A long, loose mantle to his ankles played,—
    Such vesture did his lucent shape enfold:
  His left hand bore the vocal lyre, all made
    Of gleaming shell and gold.

  He smote its strings with ivory instrument,
    And words auspicious tuned his heavenly tongue;
  Then, while his hands and voice concording blent,
    These sad, sweet words he sung:

  ""Hail, blest of Heaven! For a poet divine
    Phoebus and Bacchus and the Muses bless.
  But Bacchus and the skilful Sisters nine
    No prophecies possess.

  ""But of what Fate ordains for times to be
    Jove gave me vision. Therefore, minstrel dear!
  Receive what my unerring lips decree!
    The Cynthian wisdom hear!

  ""She whom thy love holds dearer than sweet child
    Is to a mother's breast, or virgin soft
  To longing lover, she for whom thy wild
    Prayers vex high Heaven so oft,

  ""Who worries thee each day, and vainly fills
    Dark-mantled sleep with visions that beguile,
  Lovely Neaera, theme of all thy quills,
    Now elsewhere gives her smile.

  ""For sighs not thine her fickle passions flame:
    For thy chaste house Neaera has no care.
  O cruel tribe! O woman, faithless name!
    Curse on the false and fair!

  ""But woo her still! For mutability
    Is woman's soul. Fond vows may yet prevail,
  Fierce love bears well a woman's cruelty,
    Nor at the lash will quail.

  ""That I did feed Admetus' heifers white
    Is no light tale. Upon the lyric string
  Nor more could I my joyful notes indite,
    Nor with sweet concord sing.

  ""On oaten pipe I sued the woodland Muse—
    I, of Latona and the Thunderer son!
  Thou knowst not what love is, if thou refuse
    T'endure a cruel one.

  ""Go, then, and ply her with persuasive woe!
    Soft supplications the hard heart subdue.
  Then, if my oracles the future know,
    Give her this message true:

  ""'The God whose seat is Delos' marble isle,
    Declares this marriage happy and secure.
  It has Apollo's own auspicious smile.
Cast off that rival wooer!'""

  He spoke: dull slumber from my body fell.
    Can I believe such perils round me fold?
  That such discordant vows thy tongue can tell?
    Thy heart in guilt so bold?

  Thou wert not gendered by the Pontic Sea,
    Nor where Chimaera's lips fierce flame out-pour,
  Nor of that dog with tongues and foreheads three,
    His back all snakes and gore;

  Nor out of Scylla's whelp-engirdled womb;
    Nor wert thou of fell lioness the child;
  Nor was thy cradle Scythia's forest-gloom,
    Nor Syrtis' sandy wild.

  No, but thy home was human! round its fire
    Sate creatures lovable: of all her kind
  Thy mother was the mildest, and thy sire
    Showed a most friendly mind.

  May Heaven in these bad dreams good omen show,
  And bid warm south-winds to oblivion blow!",Elegy
21,Tibullus,"You take your pleasure by Etrurian streams,
    Save when the dog-star burns:
  Or bathe you where mysterious Baiae steams,
    When purple Spring returns.

  But dread Persephone assigns to me
    The hour of gloom and fears.
  O Queen of death! be innocence my plea!
    Pity my youthful tears!

  I never have profaned that sacred shrine
    Where none but women go,
  Nor in my cup cast hemlock, or poured wine
    Death-drugged for friend or foe.

  I have not burned a temple: nor to crime
    My fevered passions given:
  Nor with wild blasphemy at worship-time
    Insulted frowning Heaven.

  Not yet is my dark hair defaced with gray,
    Nor stoop nor staff have I;
  For I was born upon that fatal day
    That saw two consuls die.

  What profits it from tender vine to tear
    The growing grape? Or who
  Would pluck with naughty hand an apple fair,
    Before its season due?

  Have mercy! gods who keep the murky stream
    Of that third kingdom dark!
  On my far future let Elysium beam!
    Postpone me Charon's bark!—

  Till wrinkled age shall make my features pale,
    And to the listening boys
  The old man babbles his repeated tale
    Of vanished days and joys!

  I trust I fear too much this fever-heat
    Which two long weeks I have,
  While with Etrurian nymphs ye sweetly meet,
    And cleave the yielding wave.

  Live lucky, friends! live loyal unto me,
    Though life, though death be mine!
  Let herds all black dread Pluto's offering be
    With white milk and red wine!",Elegy
22,Tibullus,"Come radiant Bacchus! With the hallowed leaf
    Of grape and ivy be thy forehead crowned!
  For thou canst chase away or cure my grief—
    Let love in wine be drowned!

  Dear bearer of my cup, come, brim it o'er!
    Pour forth unstinted our Falernian wine!
  Care's cruel brood is gone; I toil no more,
    If Phoebus o'er me shine.

  Dear, jovial friends, let not a lip be dry!
    Drink as I drink, and every toast obey!
  And him who will not with my wine-cup vie,
    May some false lass betray!

  This god makes all men rich. He tames proud souls,
    And bids them by a woman's hand be chained;
  Armenian tigresses his power controls,
    And lions tawny-maned.

  That love-god is as strong; but I delight
    In Bacchus rather. Fill our cups once more!
  Just and benign is he, if mortal wight
    Him and his vines adore!

  But, O! he rages, if his gift ye spurn.
    Drink, if ye dare not a god's anger brave!
  How fierce his stroke, let temperate fellows learn
    Of Pentheus' gory grave.

  Away such fear! Rather may some fierce stroke
    On that false beauty fall!—O frightful prayer!
  O, I am mad! O may my curse be broke,
    And melt in misty air!

  For, O Neaera, though I am forgot,
    I ask all gods to bless thee, every one.
  Back to my cups I go. This wine has brought
    After long storms, the sun.

  Alas! How hard to masque dull grief in joy!
    A sad heart's jest—what bitter mockery!
  With vain deceit my laughing lips employ
    Loud mirth that is a lie.

  But why complain and moan? O wretched me!
    When will my lagging sorrows haste and go?
  Delightful Bacchus at his mystery
    Forbids these words of woe.

  Once, by the wave, lone Ariadne pale,
    Abandoned of false Theseus, weeping stood:—
  Our wise Catullus tells the doleful tale
    Of love's ingratitude.

  Take warning friends! How fortunate is he,
    Who learns of others' loss his own to shun!
  Trust not caressing arms and sighs, nor be
    By flatteries undone!

  Though by her own sweet eyes her oath she swear,
    By solemn Juno, or by Venus gay,
  At oaths of love Jove laughs, and bids the air
    Waft the light things away.

  It is but folly, then, to fume and fret,
    If one light lass that old deception wrought;
  O that I too might evermore forget
    To speak my heart's true thought!

  O that my long, long nights brought peace and thee!
    That nought but thee my waking eyes did fill!
  Thou wert most false and cruel, woe is me!
    False! But I love thee still.
  How well fresh water mixes with old wine!
    Bacchus loves water-nymphs. Bring water, boy!
  What care I where she sleeps? This night of mine
    Shall I in sighs employ?

  Make the cup strong, I tell you! Stronger there!
    Wine only! While the Syrian balm o'er-flows!
  Long would I revel with anointed hair,
    And wear this wreath of rose.
",Elegy
23,Tibullus,"No! ne'er shall rival lure me from thine arms!
    (In such sweet bond did our first sighs agree!)
  Save for thine own I see no woman's charms;
    No maid in all the world is fair but thee.

  Would that no eyes but mine could find thee fair!
    Displease those others! Save me this annoy!
  I ask not envy nor the people's stare:—
    Wisest is he who loves with silent joy.

  With thee in gloomy woods my life were gay,
    Where pathway ne'er was found for human feet,
  Thou art my balm of care, in dark my day,
    In wildest waste, society complete.

  If Heaven should send a goddess to my bed,
    All were in vain. My pulse would never rise.
  I swear thee this by Juno's holy head—
    Greatest to us of all who hold the skies.

  What madness this? I give away my case!
    Swear a fool's oath! Thy tears my safety won.
  Now wilt thou flirt, and tease me to my face—
    Such mischief has my babbling fully done.

  Now am I but thy slave: yet thine remain,
    My mistress' yoke I never shall undo.
  To Venus' altar let me drag my chain!
    She brands the proud, and smiles on lovers true.",Elegy
24,Ovid,"If tears for their dead sons, in deep despair,
    Mothers of Memnon and Achilles shed,
  If gods in mortal grief have any share,
    O Muse of tears! bow down thy mournful head!

  Tibullus, thy true minstrel and best fame,
    Mere lifeless clay, on tall-built pyre doth blaze;
  While Eros, with rent bow, extinguished flame,
    And quiver empty, his wild grief displays.

  Behold, he comes with trailing wing forlorn,
    And smites with desperate hands his bosom bare!
  Tears rain unheeded o'er his tresses turn,
    And many a trembling sob his soft lips bear.

  Thus for a brother Eros mourned of yore,
    Aeneas, in Iulus' regal hall;
  Not less do Venus' eyes this death deplore
    Than when she saw her slain Adonis fall.

  Yet poets are sacred! Simple souls have deemed
    That ranked with gods we sons of song may stand,
  See one and all by sullen Death blasphemed,
    And violated by his shadowy hand!

  Little avails it Orpheus that his sire
    Was more than man; for though his songs restrain
  The wolves of Ismara, his love-lorn lyre
    Wails in the wildwood gloom with anguish vain.

  Maeonides, from whose exhaustless well
    All bards since then some tribute stream derive,—
  Him, even him, th' Avernian shades camped;
    Only his songs his scattered dust survive

  Yet songs endure. Endures the Trojan fame,
    And how Penelope's wise nights were passed.
  So Nemesis and Delia have a name,—
    A poet's earliest passion and his last.

  Live piously! Build shrines! Revere the skies!
    Death, from the temple, thrusts thee to the tomb
  Or sing divinely! Lo, Tibullus dies!
    One scanty urn gives all his ashes room.

  Could not that laurelled head the flames restrain?
    How dared they that inspired breast explore?
  Rather they should have burned some golden fane
    Of gods,—of gods who this last insult bore!

  Yet 'tis my faith the Queen of Love the while,
    Whose altars crown the bright, voluptuous steep
  Of Eryx, at that sight did lose her smile;
    Oh! I believe sweet Venus deigned to weep!

  But he had feared worse deaths: for now he lies
    Not on Phaeacia's strand in grave unknown;
  His own dear mother closed his fading eyes,
    And brought her prayers to bless his votive stone.

  Thither drew near in mournful disarray
    His sister pale, her mother's grief to share:
  Thither no less, their rival tears to pay,
    His Nemesis and Delia, fond and fair.

  There Delia murmured, ""In such love as thine
    I was too happy; thou, supremely blest,""
  Rut Nemesis: ""Nay, nay! The loss is mine;
    By mine alone his dying hand was pressed.""

  If after death, we haply may retain
    More of true being than a name and shade,
  Tibullus now the bright Elysian plain
    Doth enter, and hears stir of welcome made.

  With ivy garlands on his fadeless brow,
    Catullus hails his peer in perfect rhyme;
  Comes Calvus, too; and slandered Gallus! thou,—
    Not guilty, save if wasted love be crime!

  Such comrades now attend thy happy shade,—
    If shade in truth to our frail flesh belong:
  Th' Elysian company is larger made
    By thee, Tibullus, skilled in noble song!

  May thy bones rest in peace! is my fond prayer:
    Safe and inviolate thine urn shall be.
  Be changeless peace on thy loved relies there!

The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,
The plowman homeward plods his weary way,
And leaves the world to darkness and to me.

Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,
And all the air a solemn stillness holds,
Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,
And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;

Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r
The moping owl does to the moon complain
Of such as, wand'ring near her secret bow'r,
Molest her ancient solitary reign.

Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,
Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,
Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,
The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.

The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,
The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed,
The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,
No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.

For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,
Or busy housewife ply her evening care:
No children run to lisp their sire's return,
Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.

Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,
Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke:
How jocund did they drive their team afield!
How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!

Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,
Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;
Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
The short and simple annals of the poor.

The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r,
And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,
Awaits alike th' inevitable hour:
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.

Nor you, ye Proud, impute to These the fault,
If Memory o'er their Tomb no Trophies raise,
Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault
The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.

Can storied urn or animated bust
Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?
Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,
Or Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of death?

Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid
Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;
Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,
Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre.

But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page
Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll;
Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage,
And froze the genial current of the soul.

Full many a gem of purest ray serene
The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:
Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.

Some village Hampden that with dauntless breast
The little tyrant of his fields withstood,
Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,
Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.

Th' applause of list'ning senates to command,
The threats of pain and ruin to despise,
To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,
And read their history in a nation's eyes,

Their lot forbade: nor circumscribed alone
Their glowing virtues, but their crimes confined;
Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,
And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,

The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,
To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,
Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride
With incense kindled at the Muse's flame.

Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,
Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;
Along the cool sequester'd vale of life
They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.

Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect
Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,
The place of fame and elegy supply:
And many a holy text around she strews,
That teach the rustic moralist to die.

For who, to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind?

On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
Ev'n in our Ashes live their wonted Fires.

For thee, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead,
Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;
If chance, by lonely contemplation led,
Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,

Haply some hoary-headed Swain may say,
'Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
Brushing with hasty steps the dews away
To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech
That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
And pore upon the brook that babbles by.

'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,
Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,
Or crazed with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.

'One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;
Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;

'The next with dirges due in sad array
Slow through the church-way path we saw him borne.
Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay
Graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn:'

THE EPITAPH

Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth
A Youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.
Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.

Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.

No farther seek his merits to disclose,
Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
(There they alike in trembling hope repose,)
The bosom of his Father and his God.",Elegy
1,Dylan Thomas,"Too proud to die; broken and blind he died
The darkest way, and did not turn away,
A cold kind man brave in his narrow pride

On that darkest day, Oh, forever may
He lie lightly, at last, on the last, crossed
Hill, under the grass, in love, and there grow

Young among the long flocks, and never lie lost
Or still all the numberless days of his death, though
Above all he longed for his mother's breast

Which was rest and dust, and in the kind ground
The darkest justice of death, blind and unblessed.
Let him find no rest but be fathered and found,

I prayed in the crouching room, by his blind bed,
In the muted house, one minute before
Noon, and night, and light. the rivers of the dead

Veined his poor hand I held, and I saw
Through his unseeing eyes to the roots of the sea.
(An old tormented man three-quarters blind,

I am not too proud to cry that He and he
Will never never go out of my mind.
All his bones crying, and poor in all but pain,

Being innocent, he dreaded that he died
Hating his God, but what he was was plain:
An old kind man brave in his burning pride.

The sticks of the house were his; his books he owned.
Even as a baby he had never cried;
Nor did he now, save to his secret wound.

Out of his eyes I saw the last light glide.
Here among the liught of the lording sky
An old man is with me where I go

Walking in the meadows of his son's eye
On whom a world of ills came down like snow.
He cried as he died, fearing at last the spheres'

Last sound, the world going out without a breath:
Too proud to cry, too frail to check the tears,
And caught between two nights, blindness and death.

O deepest wound of all that he should die
On that darkest day. oh, he could hide
The tears out of his eyes, too proud to cry.

Until I die he will not leave my side.)",Elegy
2,Rainer Maria Rilke,"Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angels'
hierarchies? and even if one of them suddenly
pressed me against his heart, I would perish
in the embrace of his stronger existence.
For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror
which we are barely able to endure and are awed
because it serenely disdains to annihilate us.
Each single angel is terrifying.
And so I force myself, swallow and hold back
the surging call of my dark sobbing.
Oh, to whom can we turn for help?
Not angels, not humans;
and even the knowing animals are aware that we feel
little secure and at home in our interpreted world.
There remains perhaps some tree on a hillside
daily for us to see; yesterday's street remains for us
stayed, moved in with us and showed no signs of leaving.
Oh, and the night, the night, when the wind
full of cosmic space invades our frightened faces.
Whom would it not remain for -that longed-after,
gently disenchanting night, painfully there for the
solitary heart to achieve? Is it easier for lovers?
Don't you know yet ? Fling out of your arms the 
emptiness into the spaces we breath -perhaps the birds
will feel the expanded air in their more ferven flight.

Yes, the springtime were in need of you. Often a star
waited for you to espy it and sense its light.
A wave rolled toward you out of the distant past,
or as you walked below an open window,
a violin gave itself to your hearing.
All this was trust. But could you manage it?
Were you not always distraught by expectation,
as if all this were announcing the arrival
of a beloved?  (Where would you find a place
to hide her, with all your great strange thoughts 
coming and going and often staying for the night.)
When longing overcomes you, sing of women in love;
for their famous passion is far from immortal enough.
Those whom you almost envy, the abandoned and
desolate ones, whom you found so much more loving
than those gratified. Begin ever new again
the praise you cannot attain; remember:
the hero lives on and survives; even his downfall
was for him only a pretext for achieving
his final birth. But nature, exhausted, takes lovers
back into itself, as if such creative forces could never be
achieved a second time.
Have you thought of Gaspara Stampa sufficiently:

that any girl abandoned by her lover may feel
from that far intenser example of loving:
""Ah, might I become like her!"" Should not their oldest
sufferings finally become more fruitful for us?
Is it not time that lovingly we freed ourselves
from the beloved and, quivering, endured:
as the arrow endures the bow-string's tension,
and in this tense release becomes more than itself.
For staying is nowhere.

Voices, voices. Listen my heart, as only saints
have listened: until the gigantic call lifted them
clear off the ground. Yet they went on, impossibly,
kneeling, completely unawares: so intense was
their listening. Not that you could endure
the voice of God -far from it! But listen
to the voice of the wind and the ceaseless message
that forms itself out of silence. They sweep
toward you now from those who died young.
Whenever they entered a church in Rome or Naples,
did not their fate quietly speak to you as recently
as the tablet did in Santa Maria Formosa?
What do they want of me? to quietly remove
the appearance of suffered injustice that,
at times, hinders a little their spirits from
freely proceeding onward.

Of course, it is strange to inhabit the earth no longer,
to no longer use skills on had barely time to acquire;
not to observe roses and other things that promised
so much in terms of a human future, no longer
to be what one was in infinitely anxious hands;
to even discard one's own name as easily as a child
abandons a broken toy.
Strange, not to desire to continue wishing one's wishes.
Strange to notice all that was related, fluttering
so loosely in space. And being dead is hard work
and full of retrieving before one can gradually feel a
trace of eternity. -Yes, but the liviing make
the mistake of drawing too sharp a distinction.
Angels (they say) are often unable to distinguish
between moving among the living or the dead.
The eternal torrent whirls all ages along with it,
through both realms forever, and their voices are lost in
its thunderous roar.

In the end the early departed have no longer
need of us. One is gently weaned from things
of this world as a child outgrows the need
of its mother's breast. But we who have need 
of those great mysteries, we for whom grief is
so often the source of spiritual growth,
could we exist without them?
Is the legend vain that tells of music's beginning
in the midst of the mourning for Linos?
the daring first sounds of song piercing
the barren numbness, and how in that stunned space
an almost godlike youth suddenly left forever,
and the emptiness felt for the first time
those harmonious vibrations which now enrapture
and comfort and help us.

3,Theodore Roethke,"(My student, thrown by a horse)

I remember the neckcurls, limp and damp as tendrils; 
And her quick look, a sidelong pickerel smile; 
And how, once started into talk, the light syllables leaped for her. 
And she balanced in the delight of her thought, 
A wren, happy, tail into the wind, 
Her song trembling the twigs and small branches. 
The shade sang with her; 
The leaves, their whispers turned to kissing, 
And the mould sang in the bleached valleys under the rose. 

Oh, when she was sad, she cast herself down into such a pure depth, 
Even a father could not find her: 
Scraping her cheek against straw, 
Stirring the clearest water. 
My sparrow, you are not here, 
Waiting like a fern, making a spiney shadow. 
The sides of wet stones cannot console me, 
Nor the moss, wound with the last light. 

If only I could nudge you from this sleep, 
My maimed darling, my skittery pigeon. 
Over this damp grave I speak the words of my love: 
I, with no rights in this matter, 
Neither father nor lover.",Elegy
4,Wilfred Owen,"Hush, thrush! Hush, missen-thrush, I listen...
I heard the flush of footsteps through the loose leaves,
And a low whistle by the water's brim.

Still! Daffodil! Nay, hail me not so gaily,-
Your gay gold lily daunts me and deceives,
Who follow gleams more golden and more slim.

Look, brook! O run and look, O run!
The vain reeds shook? - Yet search till gray sea heaves,
And I will stray among these fields for him.

Gaze, daisy! Stare through haze and glare,
And mark the hazardous stars all dawns and eves,
For my eye withers, and his star wanes dim.

Close, rose, and droop, heliotrope,
And shudder, hope! The shattering winter blows.
Drop, heliotrope, and close, rose...

Mourn, corn, and sigh, rye.
Men garner you, but youth's head lies forlorn.
Sigh, rye, and mourn, corn...

Brood, wood, and muse, yews,
The ways gods use we have not understood.
Muse, yews, and brood, wood...",Elegy
5,Rainer Maria Rilke,"That some day, emerging at last from the terrifying vision
I may burst into jubilant praise to assenting angels!
That of the clear-struck keys of the heart not one may fail
to sound because of a loose, doubtful or broken string!
That my streaming countenance may make me more resplendent
That my humble weeping change into blossoms.
Oh, how will you then, nights of suffering, be remembered
with love. Why did I not kneel more fervently, disconsolate
sisters, more bendingly kneel to receive you, more loosely
surrender myself to your loosened hair? We, squanderers of
gazing beyond them to judge the end of their duration.
They are only our winter's foliage, our sombre evergreen,
one of the seasons of our interior year, -not only season,
but place, settlement, camp, soil and dwelling.

How woeful, strange, are the alleys of the City of Pain,
where in the false silence created from too much noise,
a thing cast out from the mold of emptiness
swaggers that gilded hubbub, the bursting memorial.
Oh, how completely an angel would stamp out their market
of solace, bounded by the church, bought ready for use:
as clean, disappointing and closed as a post office on Sunday.
Farther out, though, there are always the rippling edges
of the fair. Seasaws of freedom! High-divers and jugglers of zeal!
And the shooting-gallery's targets of bedizened happiness:
targets tumbling in tinny contortions whenever some better
marksman happens to hit one. From cheers to chance he goes
staggering on, as booths that can please the most curious tastes
are drumming and bawling. For adults ony there is something
special to see: how money multiplies. Anatomy made amusing!
Money's organs on view! Nothing concealed! Instructive,
and guaranteed to increase fertility!...

                                                            Oh, and then outside,
behind the farthest billboard, pasted with posters for 'Deathless,'
that bitter beer tasting quite sweet to drinkers,
if they chew fresh diversions with it..
Behind the billboard, just in back of it, life is real.
Children play, and lovers hold each other, -aside,
earnestly, in the trampled grass, and dogs respond to nature.
The youth continues onward; perhaps he is in love with
a young Lament....he follows her into the meadows.
She says: the way is long. We live out there....
                                                        Where? And the youth
follows. He is touched by her gentle bearing. The shoulders,
the neck, -perhaps she is of noble ancestry? 
Yet he leaves her, turns around, looks back and waves...
What could come of it? She is a Lament.

Only those who died young, in their first state of
timeless serenity, while they are being weaned,
follow her lovingly. She waits for girls
and befriends them. Gently she shows them
what she is wearing. Pearls of grief
and the fine-spun veils of patience.-
With youths she walks in silence.

But there, where they live, in the valley,
an elderly Lament responds to the youth as he asks:-
We were once, she says, a great race, we Laments.
Our fathers worked the mines up there in the mountains;
sometimes among men you will find a piece of polished
primeval pain, or a petrified slag from an ancient volcano.
Yes, that came from there. Once we were rich.-

And she leads him gently through the vast landscape
of Lamentation, shows him the columns of temples,
the ruins of strongholds from which long ago
the princes of Lament wisely governed the country.
Shows him the tall trees of tears,
the fields of flowering sadness,
(the living know them only as softest foliage);
show him the beasts of mourning, grazing-
and sometimes a startled bird, flying straight through
their field of vision, far away traces the image of its
solitary cry.-
At evening she leads him to the graves of elders
of the race of Lamentation, the sybils and prophets.
With night approaching, they move more softly,
and soon there looms ahead, bathed in moonlight,
the sepulcher, that all-guarding ancient stone,
Twin-brother to that on the Nile, the lofty Sphinx-:
the silent chamber's countenance.
They marvel at the regal head that has, forever silent,
laid the features of manking upon the scales of the stars.
His sight, still blinded by his early death,
cannot grasp it. But the Sphinx's gaze
frightens an owl from the rim of the double-crown.
The bird, with slow down-strokes, brushes
along the cheek, that with the roundest curve, 
and faintly inscribes on the new death-born hearing,
as though on the double page of an opened book,
the indescribable outline.

And higher up, the stars. New ones. Stars
of the land of pain. Slowly she names them:
""There, look: the Rider ,the Staff,and that 
crowded constellation they call the the Garland of Fruit.
Then farther up toward the Pole:
Cradle, Way, the Burning Book, Doll, Window.
And in the Southern sky, pure as lines
on the palm of a blessed hand, the clear sparkling M,
standing for Mothers.....""

Yet the dead  youth must go on alone.
In silence the elder Lament brings him
as far as the gorge where it shimmers in the moonlight:
The Foutainhead of Joy. With reverance she names it,
saying: ""In the world of mankind it is a life-bearing stream.""

They reach the foothills of the mountain,
and there she embraces him, weeping.

Alone, he climbs the mountains of primeval pain.
Not even his footsteps ring from this soundless fate.

But were these timeless dead to awaken an image for us,
see, they might be pointing to th catkins, hanging
from the leafless hazels, or else they might mean
the rain that falls upon the dark earth in early Spring.

And we, who always think
of happiness as rising feel the emotion
that almost overwhelms us
whenever a happy thing falls.


Translated by Albert Ernest Flemming",Elegy
6,Rainer Maria Rilke,"O trees of life, oh, what when winter comes?
We are not of one mind. Are not like birds
in unison migrating. And overtaken,
overdue, we thrust ourselves into the wind
and fall to earth into indifferent ponds.
Blossoming and withering we comprehend as one.
And somewhere lions roam, quite unaware,
in their magnificence, of any weaknesss.

But we, while wholly concentrating on one thing,
already feel the pressure of another.
Hatred is our first response. And lovers,
are they not forever invading one another's
boundaries? -although they promised space,
hunting and homeland. Then, for a sketch
drawn at a moment's impulse, a ground of contrast
is prepared, painfully, so that we may see.
For they are most exact with us. We do not know
the contours of our feelings. We only know 
what shapes them from the outside. 

Who has not sat, afraid, before his own heart's
curtain? It lifted and displayed the scenery
of departure. Easy to understand. The well-known
garden swaying just a little. Then came the dancer.
Not he! Enough! However lightly he pretends to move:
he is just disguised, costumed, an ordinary man
who enters through the kitchen when coming home.
I will not have these half-filled human masks;
better the puppet. It at least is full.
I will endure this well-stuffed doll, the wire,
the face that is nothing but appearance. Here out front
I wait. Even if the lights go down and I am told:
""There's nothing  more to come,"" -even if
the grayish drafts of emptiness come drifting down
from the deserted stage -even if not one
of my now silent forebears sist beside me
any longer, not a woman, not even a boy-
he with the brown and squinting eyes-:
I'll still remain. For one can always watch.

Am I not right?  You, to whom life would taste
so bitter, Father, after you - for my sake -
slipped of mine, that first muddy infusion
of my necessity. You kept on tasting, Father,
as I kept on growing, troubled by the aftertaste
of my so strange a future as you kept searching
my unfocused gaze -you who, so often since
you died, have been afraid for my well-being,
within my deepest hope, relinquishing that calmness,
the realms of equanimity such as the dead possess
for my so small fate -Am I not right?

And you, my parents, am I not right? You who loved me
for that small beginning of my love for you
from which I always shyly turned away, because
the distance in your features grew, changed,
even while I loved it, into cosmic space
where you no longer were...: and when I feel
inclined to wait before the puppet stage, no,
rather to stare at is so intensely that in the end
to counter-balance my searching gaze, an angel
has to come as an actor, and begin manipulating
the lifeless bodies of the puppets to perform.
Angel and puppet! Now at last there is a play!
Then what we seperate can come together by our
very presence. And only then the entire cycle
of our own life-seasons is revealed and set in motion.
Above, beyond us, the angel plays. Look:
must not the dying notice how unreal, how full
of pretense is all that we accomplish here, where
nothing is to be itself. O hours of childhood,
when behind each shape more that the past lay hidden,
when that which lay before us was not the future.

We grew, of course, and sometimes were impatient
in growing up,  half for the sake of pleasing those
with nothing left but their own grown-upness.
Yet, when alone, we entertained ourselves
with what alone endures, we would stand there
in the infinite space that spans the world and toys,
upon a place, which from the first beginnniing
had been prepared to serve a pure event.

Who shows a child just as it stands? Who places him
within his constellation, with the measuring-rod
of distance in his hand. Who makes his death
from gray bread that grows hard, -or leaves
it there inside his rounded mouth, jagged as the core
of a sweet apple?.......The minds of murderers
are easily comprehended. But this: to contain death,
the whole of death, even before life has begun,
to hold it all so gently within oneself,
and not be angry: that is indescribable.

7,Alexander Pope,"What beck'ning ghost, along the moon-light shade
Invites my steps, and points to yonder glade?
'Tis she!--but why that bleeding bosom gor'd,
Why dimly gleams the visionary sword?
Oh ever beauteous, ever friendly! tell,
Is it, in heav'n, a crime to love too well?
To bear too tender, or too firm a heart,
To act a lover's or a Roman's part?
Is there no bright reversion in the sky,
For those who greatly think, or bravely die?

Why bade ye else, ye pow'rs! her soul aspire
Above the vulgar flight of low desire?
Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes;
The glorious fault of angels and of gods;
Thence to their images on earth it flows,
And in the breasts of kings and heroes glows.
Most souls, 'tis true, but peep out once an age,
Dull sullen pris'ners in the body's cage:
Dim lights of life, that burn a length of years
Useless, unseen, as lamps in sepulchres;
Like eastern kings a lazy state they keep,
And close confin'd to their own palace, sleep.

From these perhaps (ere nature bade her die)
Fate snatch'd her early to the pitying sky.
As into air the purer spirits flow,
And sep'rate from their kindred dregs below;
So flew the soul to its congenial place,
Nor left one virtue to redeem her race.

But thou, false guardian of a charge too good,
Thou, mean deserter of thy brother's blood!
See on these ruby lips the trembling breath,
These cheeks now fading at the blast of death:
Cold is that breast which warm'd the world before,
And those love-darting eyes must roll no more.
Thus, if eternal justice rules the ball,
Thus shall your wives, and thus your children fall;
On all the line a sudden vengeance waits,
And frequent hearses shall besiege your gates.
There passengers shall stand, and pointing say,
(While the long fun'rals blacken all the way)
""Lo these were they, whose souls the furies steel'd,
And curs'd with hearts unknowing how to yield.
Thus unlamented pass the proud away,
The gaze of fools, and pageant of a day!
So perish all, whose breast ne'er learn'd to glow
For others' good, or melt at others' woe.""

What can atone (oh ever-injur'd shade!)
Thy fate unpitied, and thy rites unpaid?
No friend's complaint, no kind domestic tear
Pleas'd thy pale ghost, or grac'd thy mournful bier.
By foreign hands thy dying eyes were clos'd,
By foreign hands thy decent limbs compos'd,
By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd,
By strangers honour'd, and by strangers mourn'd!
What though no friends in sable weeds appear,
Grieve for an hour, perhaps, then mourn a year,
And bear about the mockery of woe
To midnight dances, and the public show?
What though no weeping loves thy ashes grace,
Nor polish'd marble emulate thy face?
What though no sacred earth allow thee room,
Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb?
Yet shall thy grave with rising flow'rs be drest,
And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast:
There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow,
There the first roses of the year shall blow;
While angels with their silver wings o'ershade
The ground, now sacred by thy reliques made.

So peaceful rests, without a stone, a name,
What once had beauty, titles, wealth, and fame.
How lov'd, how honour'd once, avails thee not,
To whom related, or by whom begot;
A heap of dust alone remains of thee,
'Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be!

Poets themselves must fall, like those they sung,
Deaf the prais'd ear, and mute the tuneful tongue.
Ev'n he, whose soul now melts in mournful lays,
Shall shortly want the gen'rous tear he pays;
Then from his closing eyes thy form shall part,
And the last pang shall tear thee from his heart,
Life's idle business at one gasp be o'er,
The Muse forgot, and thou belov'd no more!",Elegy
8,Wilfred Owen,"Not one corner of a foreign field
But a span as wide as Europe;

This is the Path of Glory.",Elegy

Until I labor, I in labor lie.

Off with that girdle, like heaven's zone glistering,
But a far fairer world encompassing.
Unpin that spangled breastplate which you wear,
That th' eyes of busy fools may be stopped there.
Unlace yourself, for that harmonious chime
Tells me from you that now it is bed time.
Off with that happy busk, which I envy,
That still can be, and still can stand so nigh.
Your gown, going off, such beauteous state reveals,
As when from flowry meads th' hill's shadow steals.
Off with that wiry coronet and show
The hairy diadem which on you doth grow:
Now off with those shoes, and then safely tread
In this love's hallowed temple, this soft bed.
In such white robes, heaven's angels used to be
Received by men; thou, Angel, bring'st with thee
A heaven like Mahomet's Paradise; and though
Ill spirits walk in white, we easily know
By this these angels from an evil sprite:
Those set our hairs, but these our flesh upright. 

License my roving hands, and let them go 
Before, behind, between, above, below.
O my America! my new-found-land,
My kingdom, safeliest when with one man manned,
My mine of precious stones, my empery,
How blest am I in this discovering of thee!
To enter in these bonds is to be free;
Then where my hand is set, my seal shall be.

Full nakedness! All joys are due to thee, 
As souls unbodied, bodies unclothed must be
To taste whole joys. Gems which you women use
Are like Atlanta's balls, cast in men's views,
That when a fools' eye lighteth on a gem,
His earthly soul may covet theirs, not them.
Like pictures, or like books' gay coverings made
For lay-men, are all women thus arrayed;
Themselves are mystic books, which only we
(Whom their imputed grace will dignify)
Must see revealed. Then, since that I may know,
As liberally as to a midwife, show
Thyself: cast all, yea, this white linen hence,
There is no penance due to innocence. 
To teach thee, I am naked first; why than, 
What needst thou have more covering than a man?",Elegy

gently disenchanting night, painfully there for the
solitary heart to achieve? Is it easier for lovers?
Don't you know yet ? Fling out of your arms the 
emptiness into the spaces we breath -perhaps the birds
will feel the expanded air in their more ferven flight.

Yes, the springtime were in need of you. Often a star
waited for you to espy it and sense its light.
A wave rolled toward you out of the distant past,
or as you walked below an open window,
a violin gave itself to your hearing.
All this was trust. But could you manage it?
Were you not always distraught by expectation,
as if all this were announcing the arrival
of a beloved? (Where would you find a place
to hide her, with all your great strange thoughts 
coming and going and often staying for the night.)
When longing overcomes you, sing of women in love;
for their famous passion is far from immortal enough.
Those whom you almost envy, the abandoned and
desolate ones, whom you found so much more loving
than those gratified. Begin ever new again
the praise you cannot attain; remember:
the hero lives on and survives; even his downfall
was for him only a pretext for achieving
his final birth. But nature, exhausted, takes lovers
back into itself, as if such creative forces could never be
achieved a second time.
Have you thought of Gaspara Stampa sufficiently:

that any girl abandoned by her lover may feel
from that far intenser example of loving:
""Ah, might I become like her!"" Should not their oldest
sufferings finally become more fruitful for us?
Is it not time that lovingly we freed ourselves
from the beloved and, quivering, endured:
as the arrow endures the bow-string's tension,
and in this tense release becomes more than itself.
For staying is nowhere.

Voices, voices. Listen my heart, as only saints
have listened: until the gigantic call lifted them
clear off the ground. Yet they went on, impossibly,
kneeling, completely unawares: so intense was
their listening. Not that you could endure
the voice of God -far from it! But listen
to the voice of the wind and the ceaseless message
that forms itself out of silence. They sweep
toward you now from those who died young.
Whenever they entered a church in Rome or Naples,
did not their fate quietly speak to you as recently
as the tablet did in Santa Maria Formosa?
What do they want of me? to quietly remove
the appearance of suffered injustice that,
at times, hinders a little their spirits from
freely proceeding onward.

Of course, it is strange to inhabit the earth no longer,
to no longer use skills on had barely time to acquire;
not to observe roses and other things that promised
so much in terms of a human future, no longer
to be what one was in infinitely anxious hands;
to even discard one's own name as easily as a child
abandons a broken toy.
Strange, not to desire to continue wishing one's wishes.
Strange to notice all that was related, fluttering
so loosely in space. And being dead is hard work
and full of retrieving before one can gradually feel a
trace of eternity. -Yes, but the liviing make
the mistake of drawing too sharp a distinction.
Angels (they say) are often unable to distinguish
between moving among the living or the dead.
The eternal torrent whirls all ages along with it,
through both realms forever, and their voices are lost in
its thunderous roar.

In the end the early departed have no longer
need of us. One is gently weaned from things
of this world as a child outgrows the need
of its mother's breast. But we who have need 
of those great mysteries, we for whom grief is
so often the source of spiritual growth,
could we exist without them?
Is the legend vain that tells of music's beginning
in the midst of the mourning for Linos?
the daring first sounds of song piercing
the barren numbness, and how in that stunned space
an almost godlike youth suddenly left forever,
and the emptiness felt for the first time
those harmonious vibrations which now enrapture
and comfort and help us.",Elegy
11,Jonathan Swift,"""His Grace! impossible! what, dead!
Of old age too, and in his bed!
And could that mighty warrior fall,
And so inglorious, after all?
Well, since he's gone, no matter how,
The last loud trump must wake him now;
And, trust me, as the noise grows stronger,
He'd wish to sleep a little longer.
And could he be indeed so old
As by the newspapers we're told?
Threescore, I think, is pretty high;
'Twas time in conscience he should die!
This world he cumber'd long enough;
He burnt his candle to the snuff;
And that's the reason, some folks think,
He left behind so great a stink.
Behold his funeral appears,
Nor widows' sighs, nor orphans' tears,
Wont at such times each heart to pierce,
Attend the progress of his hearse.
But what of that? his friends may say,
He had those honours in his day.
True to his profit and his pride,
He made them weep before he died

Come hither, all ye empty things!
Ye bubbles rais'd by breath of kings!
Who float upon the tide of state;
Come hither, and behold your fate!
Let pride be taught by this rebuke,
How very mean a thing's a duke;
From all his ill-got honours flung,
Turn'd to that dirt from whence he sprung""",Elegy
12,Lawrence Ferlinghetti,"A poet is born
A poet dies
And all that lies between
is us
and the world

And the world lies about it
making as if it had got his message
even though it is poetry
but most of the world wishing
it could just forget about him
and his awful strange prophecies


Along with all the other strange things
he said about the world
which were all too true
and which made them fear him
more than they loved him
though he spoke much of love

Along with all the alarms he sounded
which turned out to be false
if only for the moment
all of which made them fear his tongue
more than they loved him
Though he spoke much of love
and never lived by ‘silence exile &amp; cunning’ 
and was a loud conscientious objector to
the deaths we daily give each other
though we speak much of love


And when such a one dies
even the agents of Death should take note 
and shake the shit from their wings
in Air Force One
But they do not
And the shit still flies
And the poet now is disconnected
and won’t call back
though he spoke much of love

And still we hear him say
‘Do I not deal with angels
when her lips I touch’
And still we hear him say
‘0 my darling troubles heaven
with her loveliness’
And still we hear him say
‘As we are so wonderfully done with each other 
We can walk into our separate ‘sleep
On floors of music where the milkwhite cloak 
of childhood lies’

And still we hear him saying
‘Therefore the constant powers do not lessen 
Nor is the property of the spirit scattered 
on the cold hills of these events’
And still we hear him asking
‘Do the dead know what time it is?’

He is gone under
He is scattered
undersea
and knows what time
but won’t be back to tell it
He would be too proud to call back anyway
And too full of strange laughter
to speak to us anymore anyway

And the weight of human experience
lies upon the world
like the chains of the ‘sea
in which he sings
And he swings in the tides of the sea
And his ashes are washed
in the ides of the sea
And ‘an astonished eye looks out of the air’
to see the poet singing there

And dusk falls down a coast somewhere

where a white horse without a rider
turns its head
to the sea",Elegy
13,Anne Sexton,"In the thin classroom, where your face
was noble and your words were all things,
I find this boily creature in your place;

find you disarranged, squatting on the window sill,
irrefutably placed up there,
like a hunk of some big frog
watching us through the V
of your woolen legs.

Even so, I must admire your skill.
You are so gracefully insane.
We fidget in our plain chairs
and pretend to catalogue
our facts for your burly sorcery

or ignore your fat blind eyes
or the prince you ate yesterday
who was wise, wise, wise.",Elegy
14,Oliver Goldsmith,"Good people all, of every sort,
Give ear unto my song; 
And if you find it wondrous short,
It cannot hold you long.

In Islington there was a man
Of whom the world might say,
That still a godly race he ran— 
Whene'er he went to pray.

A kind and gentle heart he had,
To comfort friends and foes; 
The naked every day he clad— 
When he put on his clothes.

And in that town a dog was found,
As many dogs there be,
Both mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound,
And curs of low degree.

This dog and man at first were friends; 
But when a pique began,
The dog, to gain some private ends,
Went mad, and bit the man.

Around from all the neighbouring streets
The wond'ring neighbours ran,
And swore the dog had lost its wits
To bite so good a man.

The wound it seemed both sore and sad
To every Christian eye; 
And while they swore the dog was mad,
They swore the man would die.

But soon a wonder came to light
That showed the rogues they lied,— 
The man recovered of the bite,
The dog it was that died!",Elegy
15,John Donne,"By our first strange and fatal interview,
By all desires which thereof did ensue,
By our long starving hopes, by that remorse
Which my words' masculine persuasive force
Begot in thee, and by the memory
Of hurts, which spies and rivals threatened me,
I calmly beg: but by thy father's wrath,
By all pains, which want and divorcement hath,
I conjure thee, and all the oaths which I
And thou have sworn to seal joint constancy,
Here I unswear, and overswear them thus,
Thou shalt not love by ways so dangerous.
Temper, O fair Love, love's impetuous rage,
Be my true Mistress still, not my feigned Page;
I'll go, and, by thy kind leave, leave behind
Thee, only worthy to nurse in my mind
Thirst to come back; O if thou die before,
My soul from other lands to thee shall soar.
Thy (else Almighty) beauty cannot move
Rage from the Seas, nor thy love teach them love,
Nor tame wild Boreas' harshness; thou hast read
How roughly he in pieces shivered
Fair Orithea, wbom he swore he loved.
Fall ill or good, 'tis madness to have proved
Dangers unurged; feed on this flattery,
That absent Lovers one in th' other be.
Dissemble nothing, not a boy, nor change
Thy body's habit, nor mind's; be not strange
To thyself only; all will spy in thy face
A blushing womanly discovering grace;
Ricbly clothed Apes are called Apes, and as soon
Eclipsed as bright we call the Moon the Moon.
Men of France, changeable chameleons,
Spitals of diseases, shops of fashions,
Love's fuellers, and the rightest company
Of Players, which upon the world's stage be,
Will quickly know thee, and no less, alas!
Th' indifferent Italian, as we pass
His warm land, well content to think thee Page,
Will hunt thee with such lust, and hideous rage,
As Lot's fair guests were vexed. But none of these
Nor spongy hydroptic Dutch shall thee displease,
If thou stay here. O stay here, for, for thee
England is only a worthy gallery,
To walk in expectation, till from thence
Our greatest King call thee to his presence.
When I am gone, dream me some happiness,
Nor let thy looks our long-hid love confess,
Nor praise, nor dispraise me, nor bless nor curse
Openly love's force, nor in bed fright thy Nurse
With midnight's startings, crying out—oh, oh
Nurse, O my love is slain, I saw him go
O'er the white Alps alone; I saw him, I,
Assailed, fight, taken, stabbed, bleed, fall, and die.
Augur me better chance, except dread Jove
Think it enough for me t' have had thy love.",Elegy
16,John Donne,"Who ever loves, if he do not propose
The right true end of love, he's one that goes
To sea for nothing but to make him sick.
Love is a bear-whelp born: if we o'erlick
Our love, and force it new strange shapes to take,
We err, and of a lump a monster make.
Were not a calf a monster that were grown
Faced like a man, though better than his own?
Perfection is in unity: prefer
One woman first, and then one thing in her.
I, when I value gold, may think upon
The ductileness, the application,
The wholsomeness, the ingenuity,
From rust, from soil, from fire ever free;
But if I love it, 'tis because 'tis made
By our new nature (Use) the soul of trade.
All these in women we might think upon
(If women had them) and yet love but one.
Can men more injure women than to say
They love them for that by which they're not they?
Makes virtue woman? Must I cool my blood
Till I both be, and find one, wise and good?
May barren angels love so! But if we
Make love to woman, virtue is not she,
As beauty's not, nor wealth. He that strays thus
From her to hers is more adulterous
Than if he took her maid. Search every sphere
And firmament, our Cupid is not there;
He's an infernal god, and under ground
With Pluto dwells, where gold and fire abound:
Men to such gods their sacrificing coals
Did not in altars lay, but pits and holes.
Although we see celestial bodies move
Above the earth, the earth we till and love:
So we her airs contemplate, words and heart
And virtues, but we love the centric part.
Nor is the soul more worthy, or more fit,
For love than this, as infinite is it.
But in attaining this desired place
How much they err that set out at the face.
The hair a forest is of ambushes,
Of springs, snares, fetters and manacles;
The brow becalms us when 'tis smooth and plain,
And when 'tis wrinkled shipwrecks us again— 
Smooth, 'tis a paradise where we would have
Immortal stay, and wrinkled 'tis our grave.
The nose (like to the first meridian) runs
Not 'twixt an East and West, but 'twixt two suns;
It leaves a cheek, a rosy hemisphere,
On either side, and then directs us where
Upon the Islands Fortunate we fall,
(Not faint Canaries, but Ambrosial)
Her swelling lips; to which when we are come,
We anchor there, and think ourselves at home,
For they seem all: there Sirens' songs, and there
Wise Delphic oracles do fill the ear;
There in a creek where chosen pearls do swell,
The remora, her cleaving tongue doth dwell.
These, and the glorious promontory, her chin,
O'erpassed, and the straight Hellespont between
The Sestos and Abydos of her breasts,
(Not of two lovers, but two loves the nests)
Succeeds a boundless sea, but yet thine eye
Some island moles may scattered there descry;
And sailing towards her India, in that way
Shall at her fair Atlantic navel stay;
Though thence the current be thy pilot made,
Yet ere thou be where thou wouldst be embayed
Thou shalt upon another forest set,
Where many shipwreck and no further get.
When thou art there, consider what this chase
Misspent by thy beginning at the face.
Rather set out below; practise my art.
Some symetry the foot hath with that part
Which thou dost seek, and is thy map for that,
Lovely enough to stop, but not stay at;
Least subject to disguise and change it is— 
Men say the devil never can change his.
It is the emblem that hath figured
Firmness; 'tis the first part that comes to bed.
Civility we see refined; the kiss
Which at the face began, transplanted is,
Since to the hand, since to the imperial knee,
Now at the papal foot delights to be:
If kings think that the nearer way, and do
Rise from the foot, lovers may do so too;
For as free spheres move faster far than can
Birds, whom the air resists, so may that man
Which goes this empty and ethereal way,
Than if at beauty's elements he stay.
Rich nature hath in women wisely made
Two purses, and their mouths aversely laid:
They then which to the lower tribute owe
That way which that exchequer looks must go:
He which doth not, his error is as great
As who by clyster gave the stomach meat.",Elegy
17,Rainer Maria Rilke,"That some day, emerging at last from the terrifying vision
I may burst into jubilant praise to assenting angels!
That of the clear-struck keys of the heart not one may fail
to sound because of a loose, doubtful or broken string!
That my streaming countenance may make me more resplendent
That my humble weeping change into blossoms.
Oh, how will you then, nights of suffering, be remembered
with love. Why did I not kneel more fervently, disconsolate
sisters, more bendingly kneel to receive you, more loosely
surrender myself to your loosened hair? We, squanderers of
gazing beyond them to judge the end of their duration.
They are only our winter's foliage, our sombre evergreen,
one of the seasons of our interior year, -not only season,
but place, settlement, camp, soil and dwelling.

How woeful, strange, are the alleys of the City of Pain,
where in the false silence created from too much noise,
a thing cast out from the mold of emptiness
swaggers that gilded hubbub, the bursting memorial.
Oh, how completely an angel would stamp out their market
of solace, bounded by the church, bought ready for use:
as clean, disappointing and closed as a post office on Sunday.
Farther out, though, there are always the rippling edges
of the fair. Seasaws of freedom! High-divers and jugglers of zeal!
And the shooting-gallery's targets of bedizened happiness:
targets tumbling in tinny contortions whenever some better
marksman happens to hit one. From cheers to chance he goes
staggering on, as booths that can please the most curious tastes
are drumming and bawling. For adults ony there is something
special to see: how money multiplies. Anatomy made amusing!
Money's organs on view! Nothing concealed! Instructive,
and guaranteed to increase fertility!...

Oh, and then outside,
behind the farthest billboard, pasted with posters for 'Deathless,'
that bitter beer tasting quite sweet to drinkers,
if they chew fresh diversions with it..
Behind the billboard, just in back of it, life is real.
Children play, and lovers hold each other, -aside,
earnestly, in the trampled grass, and dogs respond to nature.
The youth continues onward; perhaps he is in love with
a young Lament....he follows her into the meadows.
She says: the way is long. We live out there....
Where? And the youth
follows. He is touched by her gentle bearing. The shoulders,
the neck, -perhaps she is of noble ancestry? 
Yet he leaves her, turns around, looks back and waves...
What could come of it? She is a Lament.

Only those who died young, in their first state of
timeless serenity, while they are being weaned,
follow her lovingly. She waits for girls
and befriends them. Gently she shows them
what she is wearing. Pearls of grief
and the fine-spun veils of patience.-
With youths she walks in silence.

But there, where they live, in the valley,
an elderly Lament responds to the youth as he asks:-
We were once, she says, a great race, we Laments.
Our fathers worked the mines up there in the mountains;
sometimes among men you will find a piece of polished
primeval pain, or a petrified slag from an ancient volcano.
Yes, that came from there. Once we were rich.-

And she leads him gently through the vast landscape
of Lamentation, shows him the columns of temples,
the ruins of strongholds from which long ago
the princes of Lament wisely governed the country.
Shows him the tall trees of tears,
the fields of flowering sadness,
(the living know them only as softest foliage);
show him the beasts of mourning, grazing-
and sometimes a startled bird, flying straight through
their field of vision, far away traces the image of its
solitary cry.-
At evening she leads him to the graves of elders
of the race of Lamentation, the sybils and prophets.
With night approaching, they move more softly,
and soon there looms ahead, bathed in moonlight,
the sepulcher, that all-guarding ancient stone,
Twin-brother to that on the Nile, the lofty Sphinx-:
the silent chamber's countenance.
They marvel at the regal head that has, forever silent,
laid the features of manking upon the scales of the stars.
His sight, still blinded by his early death,
cannot grasp it. But the Sphinx's gaze
frightens an owl from the rim of the double-crown.
The bird, with slow down-strokes, brushes
along the cheek, that with the roundest curve, 
and faintly inscribes on the new death-born hearing,
as though on the double page of an opened book,
the indescribable outline.

And higher up, the stars. New ones. Stars
of the land of pain. Slowly she names them:
""There, look: the Rider ,the Staff,and that 
crowded constellation they call the the Garland of Fruit.
Then farther up toward the Pole:
Cradle, Way, the Burning Book, Doll, Window.
And in the Southern sky, pure as lines
on the palm of a blessed hand, the clear sparkling M,
standing for Mothers.....""

Yet the dead youth must go on alone.
In silence the elder Lament brings him
as far as the gorge where it shimmers in the moonlight:
The Foutainhead of Joy. With reverance she names it,
saying: ""In the world of mankind it is a life-bearing stream.""

They reach the foothills of the mountain,
and there she embraces him, weeping.

Alone, he climbs the mountains of primeval pain.
Not even his footsteps ring from this soundless fate.

But were these timeless dead to awaken an image for us,
see, they might be pointing to th catkins, hanging
from the leafless hazels, or else they might mean
the rain that falls upon the dark earth in early Spring.

And we, who always think
of happiness as rising feel the emotion
that almost overwhelms us
whenever a happy thing falls.",Elegy
18,John Donne,"Fond woman, which wouldst have thy husband die,
And yet complain'st of his great jealousy;
If swol'n with poison, he lay in his last bed,
His body with a sere-bark covered,
Drawing his breath, as thick and short, as can
The nimblest crocheting musician,
Ready with loathsome vomiting to spew
His soul out of one hell, into a new,
Made deaf with his poor kindred's howling cries,
Begging with few feigned tears, great legacies,
Thou wouldst not weep, but jolly and frolic be,
As a slave, which tomorrow should be free;
Yet weep'st thou, when thou seest him hungerly
Swallow his own death, hearts-bane jealousy.
O give him many thanks, he's courteous,
That in suspecting kindly warneth us
Wee must not, as we used, flout openly,
In scoffing riddles, his deformity;
Nor at his board together being sat,
With words, nor touch, scarce looks adulterate;
Nor when he swol'n, and pampered with great fare
Sits down, and snorts, caged in his basket chair,
Must we usurp his own bed any more,
Nor kiss and play in his house, as before.
Now I see many dangers; for that is
His realm, his castle, and his diocese.
But if, as envious men, which would revile
Their Prince, or coin his gold, themselves exile
Into another country, and do it there,
We play in another house, what should we fear?
There we will scorn his houshold policies,
His seely plots, and pensionary spies,
As the inhabitants of Thames' right side
Do London's Mayor; or Germans, the Pope's pride.",Elegy
19,John Donne,"Image of her whom I love, more than she,
Whose fair impression in my faithful heart
Makes me her medal, and makes her love me,
As Kings do coins, to which their stamps impart
The value: go, and take my heart from hence,
Which now is grown too great and good for me:
Honours oppress weak spirits, and our sense
Strong objects dull; the more, the less we see.

When you are gone, and Reason gone with you,
Then Fantasy is queen and soul, and all;
She can present joys meaner than you do;
Convenient, and more proportional.
So, if I dream I have you, I have you,
For, all our joys are but fantastical.
And so I 'scape the pain, for pain is true;
And sleep which locks up sense, doth lock out all.

After a such fruition I shall wake,
And, but the waking, nothing shall repent;
And shall to love more thankful sonnets make
Than if more honour, tears, and pains were spent.
But dearest heart, and dearer image, stay;
Alas, true joys at best are dream enough;
Though you stay here you pass too fast away:
For even at first life's taper is a snuff.

Filied with her love, may I be rather grown
Mad with much heart, than idiot with none.",Elegy
20,Rainer Maria Rilke,"O trees of life, oh, what when winter comes?
We are not of one mind. Are not like birds
in unison migrating. And overtaken,
overdue, we thrust ourselves into the wind
and fall to earth into indifferent ponds.
Blossoming and withering we comprehend as one.
And somewhere lions roam, quite unaware,
in their magnificence, of any weaknesss.

But we, while wholly concentrating on one thing,
already feel the pressure of another.
Hatred is our first response. And lovers,
are they not forever invading one another's
boundaries? -although they promised space,
hunting and homeland. Then, for a sketch
drawn at a moment's impulse, a ground of contrast
is prepared, painfully, so that we may see.
For they are most exact with us. We do not know
the contours of our feelings. We only know 
what shapes them from the outside. 

Who has not sat, afraid, before his own heart's
curtain? It lifted and displayed the scenery
of departure. Easy to understand. The well-known
garden swaying just a little. Then came the dancer.
Not he! Enough! However lightly he pretends to move:
he is just disguised, costumed, an ordinary man
who enters through the kitchen when coming home.
I will not have these half-filled human masks;
better the puppet. It at least is full.
I will endure this well-stuffed doll, the wire,
the face that is nothing but appearance. Here out front
I wait. Even if the lights go down and I am told:
""There's nothing more to come,"" -even if
the grayish drafts of emptiness come drifting down
from the deserted stage -even if not one
of my now silent forebears sist beside me
any longer, not a woman, not even a boy-
he with the brown and squinting eyes-:
I'll still remain. For one can always watch.

Am I not right? You, to whom life would taste
so bitter, Father, after you - for my sake -
slipped of mine, that first muddy infusion
of my necessity. You kept on tasting, Father,
as I kept on growing, troubled by the aftertaste
of my so strange a future as you kept searching
my unfocused gaze -you who, so often since
you died, have been afraid for my well-being,
within my deepest hope, relinquishing that calmness,
the realms of equanimity such as the dead possess
for my so small fate -Am I not right?

And you, my parents, am I not right? You who loved me
for that small beginning of my love for you
from which I always shyly turned away, because
the distance in your features grew, changed,
even while I loved it, into cosmic space
where you no longer were...: and when I feel
inclined to wait before the puppet stage, no,
rather to stare at is so intensely that in the end
to counter-balance my searching gaze, an angel
has to come as an actor, and begin manipulating
the lifeless bodies of the puppets to perform.
Angel and puppet! Now at last there is a play!
Then what we seperate can come together by our
very presence. And only then the entire cycle
of our own life-seasons is revealed and set in motion.
Above, beyond us, the angel plays. Look:
must not the dying notice how unreal, how full
of pretense is all that we accomplish here, where
nothing is to be itself. O hours of childhood,
when behind each shape more that the past lay hidden,
when that which lay before us was not the future.

We grew, of course, and sometimes were impatient
in growing up, half for the sake of pleasing those
with nothing left but their own grown-upness.
Yet, when alone, we entertained ourselves
with what alone endures, we would stand there
in the infinite space that spans the world and toys,
upon a place, which from the first beginnniing
had been prepared to serve a pure event.

Who shows a child just as it stands? Who places him
within his constellation, with the measuring-rod
of distance in his hand. Who makes his death
from gray bread that grows hard, -or leaves
it there inside his rounded mouth, jagged as the core
of a sweet apple?.......The minds of murderers
are easily comprehended. But this: to contain death,
the whole of death, even before life has begun,
to hold it all so gently within oneself,
and not be angry: that is indescribable.",Elegy
21,Rainer Maria Rilke,"Ah, but the City of Pain: how strange its streets are:
the false silence of sound drowning sound,
and there--proud, brazen, effluence from the mold of emptiness--
the gilded hubbub, the bursting monument.
How an Angel would stamp out their market of solaces,
set up alongside their church bought to order:
clean and closed and woeful as a post office on Sunday.
Outside, though, there's always the billowing edge of the fair.
Swings of Freedom! High-divers and Jugglers of Zeal!
And the shooting gallery with its figures of idiot Happiness
which jump, quiver, and fall with a tinny ring
whenever some better marksman scores. Onward he lurches from cheers
to chance; for booths courting each curious taste
are drumming and barking. And then--for adults only--
a special show: how money breeds, its anatomy, not some charade:
money's genitals, everything, the whole act
from beginning to end--educational and guaranteed to make you
virile . . . . . . . . .
. . . . Oh, but just beyond that,
behind the last of the billboards, plastered with signs for ""Deathless,""
that bitter beer which tastes sweet to those drinking it
as long as they have fresh distractions to chew . . . ,
just beyond those boards, just on the other side: things are real.
Children play, lovers hold each other, off in the shadows,
pensive, on the meager grass, while dogs obey nature.
The youth is drawn farther on; perhaps he's fallen in love
with a young Lament . . . . . He pursues her, enters meadowland.
She says:
""It's a long way. We live out there . . .""
                                             Where? And the youth follows.
Something in her bearing stirs him. Her shoulders, neck--,
perhaps she's of noble descent. Still, he leaves her, turns around,
glances back, waves . . . What's the use? She's a Lament.


Translated by Edward Snow",Elegy
22,John Donne,"SINCE she must go, and I must mourn, come night, 
Environ me with darkness, whilst I write ; 
Shadow that hell unto me, which alone 
I am to suffer when my love is gone. 
Alas ! the darkest magic cannot do it, 
Thou and great hell, to boot, are shadows to it. 
Should Cynthia quit thee, Venus, and each star, 
It would not form one thought dark as mine are. 
I could lend them obscureness now, and say
Out of my self, there should be no more day. 
Such is already my self-want of sight, 
Did not the fire within me force a light. 
O Love, that fire and darkness should be mix'd, 
Or to thy triumphs such strange torments fix'd ! 
Is it because thou thyself art blind, that we, 
Thy martyrs, must no more each other see ? 
Or takest thou pride to break us on the wheel, 
And view old Chaos in the pains we feel ? 
Or have we left undone some mutual rite, 
That thus with parting thou seek'st us to spite ? 
No, no. The fault is mine, impute it to me, 
Or rather to conspiring destiny, 
Which, since I loved in jest before, decreed
That I should suffer, when I loved indeed ; 
And therefore, sooner now than I can say, 
I saw the golden fruit, 'tis rapt away ; 
Or as I'd watch'd one drop in the vast stream, 
And I left wealthy only in a dream. 
Yet, Love, thou'rt blinder than myself in this, 
To vex my dove-like friend for my amiss ; 
And where one sad truth may expiate 
Thy wrath, to make her fortune run my fate. 
So blinded justice doth, when favourites fall, 
Strike them, their house, their friends, their favourites all. 
Was't not enough that thou didst dart thy fires 
Into our bloods, inflaming our desires, 
And madest us sigh, and blow, and pant, and burn, 
And then thyself into our flames didst turn ? 
Was't not enough that thou didst hazard us 
To paths in love so dark and dangerous, 
And those so ambush'd round with household spies, 
And over all thy husband's towering eyes, 
Inflamed with th' ugly sweat of jealousy ; 
Yet went we not still on in constancy ? 
Have we for this kept guards, like spy on spy ? 
Had correspondence whilst the foe stood by ? 
Stolen, more to sweeten them, our many blisses 
Of meetings, conference, embracements, kisses ? 
Shadow'd with negligence our best respects ? 
Varied our language through all dialects 
Of becks, winks, looks, and often under boards 
Spoke dialogues with our feet far from our words ? 
Have we proved all the secrets of our art, 
Yea, thy pale inwards, and thy panting heart ? 
And, after all this passed purgatory, 
Must sad divorce make us the vulgar story ? 
First let our eyes be riveted quite through 
Our turning brain, and both our lips grow to ; 
Let our arms clasp like ivy, and our fear 
Freeze us together, that we may stick here, 
Till Fortune, that would ruin us with the deed, 
Strain his eyes open, and yet make them bleed. 
For Love it cannot be, whom hitherto 
I have accused, should such a mischief do. 
O Fortune, thou'rt not worth my least exclaim, 
And plague enough thou hast in thy own name. 
Do thy great worst ; my friend and I have charms, 
Though not against thy strokes, against thy harms. 
Rend us in sunder ; thou canst not divide 
Our bodies so, but that our souls are tied, 
And we can love by letters still and gifts, 
And thoughts and dreams ; love never wanteth shifts. 
I will not look upon the quickening sun, 
But straight her beauty to my sense shall run ; 
The air shall note her soft, the fire, most pure ; 
Waters suggest her clear, and the earth sure. 
Time shall not lose our passages ; the spring, 
How fresh our love was in the beginning ; 
The summer, how it ripen'd in the year ; 
And autumn, what our golden harvests were ; 
The winter I'll not think on to spite thee, 
But count it a lost season ; so shall she. 
And dearest friend, since we must part, drown night 
With hope of day—burdens well borne are light— ; 
The cold and darkness longer hang somewhere, 
Yet Phoebus equally lights all the sphere ; 
And what we cannot in like portion pay 
The world enjoys in mass, and so we may. 
Be then ever yourself, and let no woe 
Win on your health, your youth, your beauty ; so 
Declare yourself base Fortune's enemy, 
No less be your contempt than her inconstancy ; 
That I may grow enamour'd on your mind, 
When mine own thoughts I here neglected find. 
And this to the comfort of my dear I vow, 
My deeds shall still be what my deeds are now ; 
The poles shall move to teach me ere I start ; 
And when I change my love, I'll change my heart. 
Nay, if I wax but cold in my desire, 
Think, heaven hath motion lost, and the world, fire. 
Much more I could, but many words have made 
That oft suspected which men most persuade. 
Take therefore all in this ; I love so true, 
As I will never look for less in you.",Elegy
23,Carolyn Forché,"The page opens to snow on a field: boot-holed month, black hour
the bottle in your coat half voda half winter light.
To what and to whom does one say yes?
If God were the uncertain, would you cling to him?

Beneath a tattoo of stars the gate open, so silent so like a tomb.
This is the city you most loved, an empty stairwell
where the next rain lifts invisibly from the Seine.

With solitude, your coat open, you walk
steadily as if the railings were there and your hands weren't passing 
        through them.

""When things were ready, they poured on fuel and touched off the fire.
They waited for a high wind. It was very fine, that powdered bone.
It was put into sacks, and when there was enough we went to a bridge 
        on the Narew River.""

And even less explicit phrases survived:
""To make charcoal.
For laundry irons.""
And so we revolt against silence with a bit of speaking.
The page is a charred field where the dead would have written
We went on. And it was like living through something again one 
        could not live through again.

The soul behind you no longer inhabits your life: the unlit house
with its breathless windows and a chimney of ruined wings
where wind becomes an aria, your name, voices from a field,
And you, smoke, dissonance, a psalm, a stairwell.


Anonymous submission.",Elegy
24,Anna Akhmatova,"I have enough treasures from the past
to last me longer than I need, or want.
You know as well as I . . . malevolent memory
won't let go of half of them:
a modest church, with its gold cupola
slightly askew; a harsh chorus
of crows; the whistle of a train;
a birch tree haggard in a field
as if it had just been sprung from jail;
a secret midnight conclave
of monumental Bible-oaks;
and a tiny rowboat that comes drifting out
of somebody's dreams, slowly foundering.
Winter has already loitered here,
lightly powdering these fields,
casting an impenetrable haze
that fills the world as far as the horizon.
I used to think that after we are gone
there's nothing, simply nothing at all.
Then who's that wandering by the porch
again and calling us by name?
Whose face is pressed against the frosted pane?
What hand out there is waving like a branch?
By way of reply, in that cobwebbed corner
a sunstruck tatter dances in the mirror.",Elegy
25,John Donne,"As the sweet sweat of roses in a still,
As that which from chafed musk-cats' pores doth trill,
As the almighty balm of th' early East,
Such are the sweat drops of my mistress' breast,
And on her brow her skin such lustre sets,
They seem no sweat drops, but pearl coronets.
Rank sweaty froth thy Mistress's brow defiles,
Like spermatic issue of ripe menstruous boils,
Or like the scum, which, by need's lawless law
Enforced, Sanserra's starved men did draw
From parboiled shoes and boots, and all the rest
Which were with any sovereigne fatness blest,
And like vile lying stones in saffroned tin,
Or warts, or weals, they hang upon her skin.
Round as the world's her head, on every side,
Like to the fatal ball which fell on Ide,

Or that whereof God had such jealousy,
As, for the ravishing thereof we die.
Thy head is like a rough-hewn statue of jet,
Where marks for eyes, nose, mouth, are yet scarce set;
Like the first Chaos, or flat-seeming face
Of Cynthia, when th' earth's shadows her embrace.
Like Proserpine's white beauty-keeping chest,
Or Jove's best fortunes urn, is her fair breast.
Thine's like worm-eaten trunks, clothed in seals' skin,
Or grave, that's dust without, and stink within.
And like that slender stalk, at whose end stands
The woodbine quivering, are her arms and hands.
Like rough barked elm-boughs, or the russet skin
Of men late scourged for madness, or for sin,
Like sun-parched quarters on the city gate,
Such is thy tanned skin's lamentable state.
And like a bunch of ragged carrots stand
The short swol'n fingers of thy gouty hand.
Then like the Chimic's masculine equal fire,
Which in the Lymbecks warm womb doth inspire
Into th' earth's worthless dirt a soul of gold,
Such cherishing heat her best loved part doth hold.
Thine's like the dread mouth of a fired gun,
Or like hot liquid metals newly run
Into clay moulds, or like to that Etna
Where round about the grass is burnt away.
Are not your kisses then as filthy, and more,
As a worm sucking an envenomed sore?
Doth not thy feareful hand in feeling quake,
As one which gath'ring flowers still fears a snake?
Is not your last act harsh, and violent,
As when a plough a stony ground doth rent?
So kiss good turtles, so devoutly nice
Are priests in handling reverent sacrifice,
And such in searching wounds the surgeon is
As we, when we embrace, or touch, or kiss.
Leave her, and I will leave comparing thus,
She, and comparisons are odious.",Elegy
26,John Donne,"Here take my picture; though I bid farewell
Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell.
'Tis like me now, but I dead, 'twill be more
When we are shadows both, than 'twas before.
When weather-beaten I come back, my hand
Perhaps with rude oars torn, or sun beams tann'd,
My face and breast of haircloth, and my head
With care's rash sudden storms being o'erspread,
My body'a sack of bones, broken within,
And powder's blue stains scatter'd on my skin;
If rival fools tax thee to'have lov'd a man
So foul and coarse as, oh, I may seem then,
This shall say what I was, and thou shalt say,
'Do his hurts reach me? doth my worth decay?
Or do they reach his judging mind, that he
Should now love less, what he did love to see?
That which in him was fair and delicate,
Was but the milk which in love's childish state
Did nurse it; who now is grown strong enough
To feed on that, which to disus'd tastes seems tough.'",Elegy
27,Ovid,"In summer's heat and mid-time of the day
To rest my limbs upon a bed I lay,
One window shut, the other open stood,
Which gave such light, as twinkles in a wood,
Like twilight glimpse at setting of the sun,
Or night being past, and yet not day begun.
Such light to shamefast maidens must be shown,
Where they must sport, and seem to be unknown.
Then came Corinna in a long loose gown,
Her white neck hid with tresses hanging down:
Resembling fair Semiramis going to bed
Or Layis of a thousand wooers sped.
I snatched her gown, being thin, the harm was small,
Yet strived she to be covered there withal.
And striving thus as one that would be chaste,
Betrayed herself, and yeilded at the last.
Stark naked as she stood before mine eye,
Not one wen in her body could I spy.
What arms and shoulders did I touch and see,
How apt her breasts were to be pressed by me.
How smooth a belly under her waist saw I?
How large a leg, and what a lusty thigh?
To leave the rest, all liked me passing well,
I clinged her naked body, down she fell,
Judge you the rest, being tired she bade me kiss,
Jove sent me more such afternoons as this.",Elegy
28,Gilbert Keith Chesterton,"The men that worked for England 
They have their graves at home: 
And bees and birds of England 
About the cross can roam. 

But they that fought for England, 
Following a falling star, 
Alas, alas for England 
They have their graves afar. 

And they that rule in England, 
In stately conclave met, 
Alas, alas for England, 
They have no graves as yet.",Elegy
29,John Donne,"Once, and but once found in thy company,
All thy supposed escapes are laid on me;
And as a thief at bar is questioned there
By all the men that have been robed that year,
So am I (by this traiterous means surprized)
By thy hydroptic father catechized.
Though he had wont to search with glazed eyes,
As though he came to kill a cockatrice,
Though he hath oft sworn that he would remove
Thy beauty's beauty, and food of our love,
Hope of his goods, if I with thee were seen,
Yet close and secret, as our souls, we've been.
Though thy immortal mother, which doth lie
Still-buried in her bed, yet wiil not die,
Takes this advantage to sleep out daylight,
And watch thy entries and returns all night,
And, when she takes thy hand, and would seem kind,
Doth search what rings and armlets she can find,
And kissing, notes the colour of thy face,
And fearing lest thou'rt swol'n, doth thee embrace;
To try if thou long, doth name strange meats,
And notes thy paleness, blushing, sighs, and sweats;
And politicly will to thee confess
The sins of her own youth's rank lustiness;
Yet love these sorceries did remove, and move
Thee to gull thine own mother for my love.
Thy little brethren, which like faery sprites
Oft skipped into our chamber, those sweet nights,
And kissed, and ingled on thy father's knee,
Were bribed next day to tell what they did see:
The grim eight-foot-high iron-bound servingman,
That oft names God in oaths, and only then,
He that to bar the first gate doth as wide
As the great Rhodian Colossus stride,
Which, if in hell no other pains there were,
Makes me fear hell, because he must be there:
Though by thy father he were hired to this,
Could never witness any touch or kiss.
But Oh, too common ill, I brought with me
That which betrayed me to my enemy:
A loud perfume, which at my entrance cried
Even at thy father's nose, so were we spied;
When, like a tyran King, that in his bed
Smelt gunpowder, the pale wretch shivered.
Had it been some bad smell he would have thought
That his own feet, or breath, that smell had wrought.
But as we in our isle imprisoned,
Where cattle only, and diverse dogs are bred,
The precious Unicorns strange monsters call,
So thought he good, strange, that had none at all.
I taught my silks their whistling to forbear,
Even my oppressed shoes dumb and speechless were,
Only, thou bitter sweet, whom I had laid
Next me, me traiterously hast betrayed,
And unsuspected hast invisibly
At once fled unto him, and stayed with me.
Base excrement of earth, which dost confound
Sense from distinguishing the sick from sound;
By thee the seely amorous sucks his death
By drawing in a leprous harlot's breath;
By thee the greatest stain to man's estate
Falls on us, to be called effeminate;
Though you be much loved in the Prince's hall,
There, things that seem, exceed substantial.
Gods, when ye fumed on altars, were pleased well,
Because you were burnt, not that they liked your smell;
You're loathsome all, being taken simply alone,
Shall we love ill things joined, and hate each one?
If you were good, your good doth soon decay;
And you are rare, that takes the good away.
All my perfumes I give most willingly
T' embalm thy father's corse; What? will he die?",Elegy
30,John Donne,"No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace
    As I have seen in one autumnal face.
Young beauties force our love, and that's a rape,
    This doth but counsel, yet you cannot scape.
If 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame;
    Affection here takes reverence's name.
Were her first years the golden age? That's true,
    But now she's gold oft tried and ever new.
That was her torrid and inflaming time,
    This is her tolerable tropic clime.
Fair eyes, who asks more heat than comes from hence,
    He in a fever wishes pestilence.
Call not these wrinkles, graves; if graves they were,
    They were Love's graves, for else he is no where.
Yet lies not Love dead here, but here doth sit
    Vow'd to this trench, like an anachorit;
And here till hers, which must be his death, come,
    He doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb.
Here dwells he; though he sojourn ev'rywhere
    In progress, yet his standing house is here:
Here where still evening is, not noon nor night,
    Where no voluptuousness, yet all delight.
In all her words, unto all hearers fit,
    You may at revels, you at council, sit.
This is Love's timber, youth his underwood;
    There he, as wine in June, enrages blood,
Which then comes seasonabliest when our taste
    And appetite to other things is past.
Xerxes' strange Lydian love, the platan tree,
    Was lov'd for age, none being so large as she,
Or else because, being young, nature did bless
    Her youth with age's glory, barrenness.
If we love things long sought, age is a thing
    Which we are fifty years in compassing;
If transitory things, which soon decay,
    Age must be loveliest at the latest day.
But name not winter faces, whose skin's slack,
    Lank as an unthrift's purse, but a soul's sack;
Whose eyes seek light within, for all here's shade;
    Whose mouths are holes, rather worn out than made;
Whose every tooth to a several place is gone,
    To vex their souls at resurrection:
Name not these living death's-heads unto me,
    For these, not ancient, but antique be.
I hate extremes, yet I had rather stay
    With tombs than cradles, to wear out a day.
Since such love's natural lation is, may still
    My love descend, and journey down the hill,
Not panting after growing beauties. So,
    I shall ebb on with them who homeward go.",Elegy
31,John Donne,"Marry, and love thy Flavia, for she
Hath all things whereby others beautious be,
For, though her eyes be small, her mouth is great,
Though they be ivory, yet her teeth be jet,
Though they be dim, yet she is light enough,
And though her harsh hair fall, her skin is rough;
What though her cheeks be yellow, her hair's red;
Give her thine, and she hath a maidenhead.
These things are beauty's elements, where these
Meet in one, that one must, as perfect, please.
If red and white and each good quality
Be in thy wench, ne'er ask where it doth lie.
In buying things perfumed, we ask if there
Be musk and amber in it, but not where.
Though all her parts be not in th' usual place,
She hath yet an anagram of a good face.
If we might put the letters but one way,
In the lean dearth of words, what could we say?
When by the Gamut some Musicians make
A perfect song, others will undertake,
By the same Gamut changed, to equal it.
Things simply good can never be unfit.
She's fair as any, if all be like her,
And if none be, then she is singular.
All love is wonder; if we justly do
Account her wonderful, why not lovely too?
Love built on beauty, soon as beauty, dies;
Choose this face, changed by no deformities.
Women are all like angels; the fair be
Like those which fell to worse; but such as thee,
Like to good angels, nothing can impair:
'Tis less grief to be foul than t' have been fair.
For one night's revels, silk and gold we choose,
But, in long journeys, cloth and leather use.
Beauty is barren oft; best husbands say,
There is best land where there is foulest way.
Oh what a sovereign plaster will she be,
If thy past sins have taught thee jealousy!
Here needs no spies, nor eunuchs; her commit
Safe to thy foes; yea, to a Marmosit.
When Belgia's cities the round countries drown,
That dirty foulness guards, and arms the town:
So doth her face guard her; and so, for thee,
Which, forced by business, absent oft must be,
She, whose face, like clouds, turns the day to night;
Who, mightier than the sea, makes Moors seem white;
Who, though seven years she in the stews had laid,
A Nunnery durst receive, and think a maid;
And though in childbed's labour she did lie,
Midwives would swear 'twere but a tympany;
Whom, if she accuse herself, I credit less
Than witches, which impossibles confess;
Whom dildoes, bedstaves, and her velvet glass
Would be as loath to touch as Joseph was:
One like none, and liked of none, fittest were,
For, things in fashion every man will wear.",Elegy
32,John Donne,"Nature's lay idiot, I taught thee to love,
And in that sophistry, Oh, thou dost prove
Too subtle: Foole, thou didst not understand
The mystic language of the eye nor hand:
Nor couldst thou judge the difference of the air
Of sighs, and say, This lies, this sounds despair:
Nor by th' eyes water call a malady
Desperately hot, or changing feverously.
I had not taught thee, then, the Alphabet
Of flowers, how they devisefully being set
And bound up might with speechless secrecy
Deliver errands mutely, and mutually.
Remember since all thy words used to be
To every suitor, Ay, if my friends agree;
Since, household charms, thy husband's name to teach,
Were all the love tricks that thy wit could reach;
And since, an hour's discourse could scarce have made
One answer in thee, and that ill arrayed
In broken proverbs and torn sentences.
Thou art not by so many duties his,
That from the world's Common having severed thee,
Inlaid thee, neither to be seen, nor see,
As mine: who have with amorous delicacies
Refined thee into a blisful Paradise.
Thy graces and good words my creatures be;
I planted knowledge and life's tree in thee,
Which Oh, shall strangers taste? Must I alas
Frame and enamel plate, and drink in glass?
Chaf wax for others' seals? break a colt's force
And leave him then, being made a ready horse?",Elegy
33,Edna St. Vincent Millay,"There will be rose and rhododendron
When you are dead and under ground;
Still will be heard from white syringas
Heavy with bees, a sunny sound;

Still will the tamaracks be raining
After the rain has ceased, and still
Will there be robins in the stubble,
Brown sheep upon the warm green hill.

Spring will not ail nor autumn falter;
Nothing will know that you are gone,
Saving alone some sullen plough-land
None but yourself sets foot upon;

Saving the may-weed and the pig-weed
Nothing will know that you are dead,—
These, and perhaps a useless wagon
Standing beside some tumbled shed.

Oh, there will pass with your great passing
Little of beauty not your own,—
Only the light from common water,
Only the grace from simple stone!",Elegy
34,John Donne,"Although thy hand and faith, and good works too,
Have seal'd thy love which nothing should undo,
Yea though thou fall back, that apostasy
Confirm thy love; yet much, much I fear thee.
Women are like the Arts, forc'd unto none,
Open to'all searchers, unpriz'd, if unknown.
If I have caught a bird, and let him fly,
Another fouler using these means, as I,
May catch the same bird; and, as these things be,
Women are made for men, not him, nor me.
Foxes and goats; all beasts change when they please,
Shall women, more hot, wily, wild then these,
Be bound to one man, and did Nature then
Idly make them apter to endure than men?
They are our clogges, not their owne; if a man be
Chain'd to a galley, yet the galley is free;
Who hath a plow-land, casts all his seed corn there,
And yet allows his ground more corn should bear;
Though Danuby into the sea must flow,
The sea receives the Rhene, Volga, and Po.
By nature, which gave it, this liberty
Thou lov'st, but Oh! canst thou love it and me?
Likeness glues love: Then if so thou do,
To make us like and love, must I change too?
More than thy hate, I hate it, rather let me
Allow her change, then change as oft as she,
And so not teach, but force my opinion
To love not any one, nor every one.
To live in one land is captivity,
To run all countries, a wild roguery;
Waters stink soon, if in one place they bide,
And in the vast sea are worse putrified:
But when they kiss one bank, and leaving this
Never look back, but the next bank do kiss,
Then are they purest; Change is the nursery
Of music, joy, life, and eternity.",Elegy
35,Edna St. Vincent Millay,"Let them bury your big eyes
In the secret earth securely,
Your thin fingers, and your fair,
Soft, indefinite-colored hair,—
All of these in some way, surely,
From the secret earth shall rise;
Not for these I sit and stare,
Broken and bereft completely;
Your young flesh that sat so neatly
On your little bones will sweetly
Blossom in the air.

But your voice,—never the rushing
Of a river underground,
Not the rising of the wind
In the trees before the rain,
Not the woodcock's watery call,
Not the note the white-throat utters,
Not the feet of children pushing
Yellow leaves along the gutters
In the blue and bitter fall,
Shall content my musing mind
For the beauty of that sound
That in no new way at all
Ever will be heard again.

Sweetly through the sappy stalk
Of the vigorous weed,
Holding all it held before,
Cherished by the faithful sun,
On and on eternally
Shall your altered fluid run,
Bud and bloom and go to seed;
But your singing days are done;
But the music of your talk
Never shall the chemistry
Of the secret earth restore.
All your lovely words are spoken.

Beats the golden bird no more.",Elegy
36,Jonathan Swift,"Her dead lady's joy and comfort,
Who departed this life
The last day of March, 1727:
To the great joy of Bryan
That his antagonist is gone.

And is poor Tiger laid at last so low?
O day of sorrow! -Day of dismal woe!
Bloodhounds, or spaniels, lap-dogs, 'tis all one,
When Death once whistles -snap! -away they're gone.
See how she lies, and hangs her lifeless ears,
Bathed in her mournful lady's tears!
Dumb is her throat, and wagless is her tail,
Doomed to the grave, to Death's eternal jail!
In a few days this lovely creature must
First turn to clay, and then be changed to dust.
That mouth which used its lady's mouth to lick
Must yield its jaw-bones to the worms to pick.
That mouth which used the partridge-wing to eat
Must give its palate to the worms to eat.

Methinks I see her now in Charon's boat
Bark at the Stygian fish which round it float;
While Cerberus, alarmed to hear the sound,
Makes Hell's wide concave bellow all around.
She sees him not, but hears him through the dark,
And valiantly returns him bark for bark.
But now she trembles -though a ghost, she dreads
To see a dog with three large yawning heads.
Spare her, you hell-hounds, case your frightful paws,
And let poor Tiger 'scape your furious jaws.
Let her go safe to the Elysian plains,
Where Hylax barks among the Mantuan swains;
There let her frisk about her new-found love:
She loved a dog when she was here above.

10   All mortal pleasures in a moment fade:
11   Our surest hope is in an hour destroy'd,
12   And love, best gift of heav'n, not long enjoy'd.

13         Methinks I see her frantic with despair,
14   Her streaming eyes, wrung hands, and flowing hair
15   Her Mechlen pinners rent the floor bestrow,
16   And her torn fan gives real signs of woe.
17   Hence Superstition, that tormenting guest,
18   That haunts with fancied fears the coward breast;
19   No dread events upon his fate attend,
20   Stream eyes no more, no more thy tresses rend.
21   Tho' certain omens oft forewarn a state,
22   And dying lions show the monarch's fate;
23   Why should such fears bid Celia's sorrow rise?
24   For when a lap-dog falls no lover dies.

25         Cease, Celia, cease; restrain thy flowing tears,
26   Some warmer passion will dispel thy cares.
27   In man you'll find a more substantial bliss,
28   More grateful toying, and a sweeter kiss.

29         He's dead. Oh lay him gently in the ground!
30   And may his tomb be by this verse renown'd.

39,Siegfried Sassoon,"Your dextrous wit will haunt us long 
Wounding our grief with yesterday. 
Your laughter is a broken song; 
And death has found you, kind and gay. 

We may forget those transient things
That made your charm and our delight: 
But loyal love has deathless wings 
That rise and triumph out of night. 

So, in the days to come, your name 
Shall be as music that ascends 
When honour turns a heart from shame... 
O heart of hearts! ... O friend of friends!",Elegy
40,John Donne,"Oh, let me not serve so, as those men serve
Whom honour's smokes at once fatten and starve;
Poorly enrich't with great men's words or looks;
Nor so write my name in thy loving books
As those idolatrous flatterers, which still
Their Prince's styles, with many realms fulfil
Whence they no tribute have, and where no sway.
Such services I offer as shall pay
Themselves, I hate dead names: Oh then let me
Favourite in Ordinary, or no favourite be.
When my soul was in her own body sheathed,
Nor yet by oaths betrothed, nor kisses breathed
Into my Purgatory, faithless thee,
Thy heart seemed wax, and steel thy constancy:
So, careless flowers strowed on the waters face
The curled whirlpools suck, smack, and embrace,
Yet drown them; so, the taper's beamy eye
Amorously twinkling beckons the giddy fly,
Yet burns his wings; and such the devil is,
Scarce visiting them who are entirely his.
When I behold a stream which, from the spring,
Doth with doubtful melodious murmuring,
Or in a speechless slumber, calmly ride
Her wedded channels' bosom, and then chide
And bend her brows, and swell if any bough
Do but stoop down, or kiss her upmost brow:
Yet, if her often gnawing kisses win
The traiterous bank to gape, and let her in,
She rusheth violently, and doth divorce
Her from her native, and her long-kept course,
And roars, and braves it, and in gallant scorn,
In flattering eddies promising retorn,
She flouts the channel, who thenceforth is dry;
Then say I, That is she, and this am I.
Yet let not thy deep bitterness beget
Careless despair in me, for that will whet
My mind to scorn; and Oh, love dulled with pain
Was ne'er so wise, nor well armed as disdain.
Then with new eyes I shall survey thee, and spy
Death in thy cheeks, and darkness in thine eye.
Though hope bred faith and love: thus taught, I shall,
As nations do from Rome, from thy love fall.
My hate shall outgrow thine, and utterly
I will renounce thy dalliance: and when I
Am the recusant, in that resolute state,
What hurts it me to be excommunicate?",Elegy
41,Sandra Fowler,"Cold sunshine writes our elegy in frost, 
Author of light a million snowflakes lost, 
All gone forever into swirling air, 
A dance of death that is no longer there.

Pure poetry becomes a stanza said, 
Classical white a message left unread, 
While we stand longing for a winter past, 
Hurt by a mood that was too fey to last.

43,John Donne,"TO make the doubt clear, that no woman's true,
Was it my fate to prove it strong in you?
Thought I, but one had breathèd purest air ;
And must she needs be false, because she's fair?
Is it your beauty's mark, or of your youth,
Or your perfection, not to study truth?
Or think you heaven is deaf, or hath no eyes?
Or those it hath smile at your perjuries?
Are vows so cheap with women, or the matter
Whereof they're made, that they are writ in water,
And blown away with wind?   Or doth their breath
Both hot and cold, at once make life and death?
Who could have thought so many accents sweet
Form'd into words, so may sighs should meet
As from our hearts, so many oaths, and tears
Sprinkled among, all sweeten'd by our fears,
And the divine impression of stolen kisses,
That seal'd the rest, should now prove empty blisses?
Did you draw bonds to forfeit? sign to break?
Or must we read you quite from what you speak,
And find the truth out the wrong way? or must
He first desire you false, would wish you just?
O ! I profane ! though most of women be
This kind of beast, my thoughts shall except thee,
My dearest love ; though froward jealousy
With circumstance might urge thy inconstancy,
Sooner I'll think the sun will cease to cheer
The teeming earth, and that forget to bear ;
Sooner that rivers will run back, or Thames
With ribs of ice in June will bind his streams ;
Or nature, by whose strength the world endures,
Would change her course, before you alter yours.
But O ! that treacherous breast, to whom weak you
Did drift our counsels, and we both may rue,
Having his falsehood found too late ; 'twas he
That made me cast you guilty, and you me ;
Whilst he, black wretch, betray'd each simple word
We spake, unto the cunning of a third.
Cursed may he be, that so our love hath slain,
And wander on the earth, wretched as Cain,
Wretched as he, and not deserve least pity.
In plaguing him, let misery be witty ;
Let all eyes shun him, and he shun each eye,
Till he be noisome as his infamy ;
May he without remorse deny God thrice,
And not be trusted more on his soul's price ;
And, after all self-torment, when he dies,
May wolves tear out his heart, vultures his eyes,
Swine eat his bowels, and his falser tongue
That utter'd all, be to some raven flung ;
And let his carrion corse be a longer feast
To the king's dogs, than any other beast.
Now have I cursed, let us our love revive ;
In me the flame was never more alive.
I could begin again to court and praise,
And in that pleasure lengthen the short days
Of my life's lease ; like painters that do take
Delight, not in made work, but whiles they make.
I could renew those times, when first I saw
Love in your eyes, that gave my tongue the law
To like what you liked ; and at masks and plays
Commend the self-same actors, the same ways ;
Ask how you did, and often with intent
Of being officious, be impertinent ;
All which were such soft pastimes, as in these
Love was as subtly catch'd as a disease.
But being got, it is a treasure sweet,
Which to defend is harder than to get ;
And ought not be profaned, on either part,
For though 'tis got by chance, 'tis kept by art.",Elegy
44,Joseph Brodsky,"About a year has passed. I've returned to the place of the battle,
to its birds that have learned their unfolding of wings 
from a subtle
lift of a surprised eyebrow, or perhaps from a razor blade
- wings, now the shade of early twilight, now of state 
bad blood.

Now the place is abuzz with trading
in your ankles's remnants, bronzes
of sunburnt breastplates, dying laughter, bruises,
rumors of fresh reserves, memories of high treason,
laundered banners with imprints of the many
    who since have risen.

All's overgrown with people. A ruin's a rather stubborn
architectural style. And the hearts's distinction
from a pitch-black cavern
isn't that great; not great enough to fear
that we may collide again like blind eggs somewhere.

At sunrise, when nobody stares at one's face, I often,
set out on foot to a monument cast in molten
lengthy bad dreams. And it says on the plinth ""commander

45,Ovid,"If Memnon's mother mourned, Achilles's mother mourned, 
   and our sad fates can touch great goddesses, 
then weep, and loose your hair in grief you never earned, 
   Elegy, now ah! too much like your name.
That bard whose work was yours, who gave you fame, Tibullus, 
   burns on the mounded pyre, a lifeless corpse.
See Venus's boy, bearing his quiver upside down; 
   his bow is broken and his torch is quenched; 
look how he goes dejected:  his wings trail on the ground; 
   he smites his naked breast with violent hand; 
his tears dampen the curls that fall around his neck, 
   and heaving sobs keep breaking on his lips.
(Just so he went out, fair Iulus, from your house, 
   they say, at his brother Aeneas's funeral.) 
No less was Venus stunned by her Tibullus's death
   than when the fierce boar smote her lover's thigh.
They say we bards are sacred, favorites of the gods, 
   and even that there's something holy in us, 
but that churl Death defiles every sacred thing: 
   his shadowy hand appropriates us all.
Was Orpheus saved by his father and mother, who were gods, 
   or by his songs that tamed the astonished beasts? 
They say that that same father sang 'Linos!  Ai, Linos! '
   deep in the woods on his reluctant lyre.
And Homer, too, from whom, as from an endless fount, 
   bards' lips are moistened with the Muses' waters, 
one last day pulled him under Avernus's murky wave: 
   his songs alone escaped the greedy pyre.
The work of bards endures:  Troy's famous sufferings, 
   and the endless shroud, undone by nightly fraud.
So Nemesis and Delia:  both their names will live, 
   the one his first, the one his latest love.
But what use now your rites?  What use the Egyptian rattle? 
   What use, to have slept alone in an empty bed? 
When harsh fate steals away the good (forgive my words!) 
   I almost want to believe there are no gods.
Live virtuous:  you will die.  Respect the gods:  grim Death
   will drag you from their altars to your grave.
Write glorious verse, and see!  here Tibullus lies: 
   one small urn holds the dust of what he was.
Is it you the blazing pyre bears off, O sacred bard, 
   not dreading to be fed upon your breast? 
Flames that dare so great a blasphemy would burn
   the golden temples of the blessed gods! 
She turned aside her gaze who rules Mt. Eryx's heights, 
   and some say she could not restrain her tears.
And yet it's better thus than if Phaeacia's land
   had strewn mere dirt on your neglected grave.
Here, as you fled life, your mother closed your streaming
   eyes, and brought her last gifts to your ashes.
Here your sister joined your mother in her grief
   and came with loosened hair all disarrayed.
And with their kisses Nemesis and your first love
   joined theirs, and did not leave your pyre forsaken, 
and Delia, as she left, said, 'Happier far your love
   for me:  you lived, while I was still your flame.'
'Why, ' Nemesis replied, 'do you grieve for my loss? 
   Dying, he clutched me with his failing hand.'
If anything remains of us but name and shade, 
   Elysium's vale will be Tibullus's home, 
and you will greet him, learned Catullus, ivy bound
   on your young brow, with Calvus at your side, 
and you (if it is false that you betrayed your friend) 
   Gallus, careless of your blood and soul.
These shades will be your comrades, if any shades there are: 
   you have joined the blessed, elegant Tibullus.
May your bones find repose within their sheltering urn, 
   and may earth not lie heavy on your ashes.

46,James Thomson,"Now, Chatto, you're a dreary place,
Pale sorrow broods on ilka face;
Therburn has run his race.
And now, and now, ah me, alas!
The carl lies dead.

Having his paternoster said,
He took a dram and went to bed;
He fell asleep, and death was glad
That he had catched him; 
For Therburn was e'en ill bested,
That none did watch him.

For had the carl but been aware,
That meagre death, who none does spare,
T'attempt sic things should ever dare,
As stop his pipe;
He might have come to flee or scare;
The greedy gripe.

48,John Donne,"By our first strange and fatal interview,
By all desires which thereof did ensue,
By our long starving hopes, by that remorse
Which my words masculine persuasive force
Begot in thee, and by the memory
Of hurts, which spies and rivals threaten'd me,
I calmly beg. But by thy father's wrath,
By all pains, which want and divorcement hath,
I conjure thee, and all the oaths which I
And thou have sworn to seal joint constancy,
Here I unswear, and overswear them thus ;
Thou shalt not love by ways so dangerous.
Temper, O fair love, love's impetuous rage ;
Be my true mistress still, not my feign'd page.
I'll go, and, by thy kind leave, leave behind
Thee, only worthy to nurse in my mind
Thirst to come back ; O ! if thou die before,
My soul from other lands to thee shall soar.
Thy else almighty beauty cannot move
Rage from the seas, nor thy love teach them love,
Nor tame wild Boreas' harshness ; thou hast read
How roughly he in pieces shivered
Fair Orithea, whom he swore he loved.
Fall ill or good, 'tis madness to have proved
Dangers unurged ; feed on this flattery,
That absent lovers one in th' other be.
Dissemble nothing, not a boy, nor change
Thy body's habit, nor mind ; be not strange
To thyself only. All will spy in thy face
A blushing womanly discovering grace.
Richly clothed apes are call'd apes, and as soon
Eclipsed as bright, we call the moon the moon.
Men of France, changeable chameleons,
Spitals of diseases, shops of fashions,
Love's fuellers, and the rightest company
Of players, which upon the world's stage be,
Will quickly know thee, and no less, alas !
Th' indifferent Italian, as we pass
His warm land, well content to think thee page,
Will hunt thee with such lust, and hideous rage,
As Lot's fair guests were vex'd. But none of these
Nor spongy hydroptic Dutch shall thee displease,
If thou stay here. O stay here, for for thee
England is only a worthy gallery,
To walk in expectation, till from thence
Our greatest king call thee to his presence.
When I am gone, dream me some happiness ;
Nor let thy looks our long-hid love confess ;
Nor praise, nor dispraise me, nor bless nor curse
Openly love's force, nor in bed fright thy nurse
With midnight's startings, crying out, O ! O !
Nurse, O ! my love is slain ; I saw him go
O'er the white Alps alone ; I saw him, I,
Assail'd, fight, taken, stabb'd, bleed, fall, and die.
Augur me better chance, except dread Jove

49,Yosa Buson,"You left in the morning, at evening my heart is in a
thousand pieces.
Why is it so far away?

Thinking of you, I go up on the hill and wander.
Around the hill, why is it such a sadness?

Dandelions yellow and shepherds-purse blooming white --
not anyone to look at them.

I hear a pheasant, calling and calling fervently.
Once a friend was there across the river, living.

Ghostly smoke rises and fades away with a west wind
strong in fields of small bamboo grasses and reedy fields.
Nowhere to leave for.

Once a friend was there across the river, living, but today
not even a bird sings a song.

You left in the morning, at evening my heart is in a
thousand pieces.
Why is it so far away?

In my grass hut by the Amida image I light no candle,
offer no flowers, and only sit here alone.
This evening, how invaluable it is.

50,Mark Akenside,"Too much my heart of Beauty's power hath known,
Too long to Love hath reason left her throne;
Too long my genius mourn'd his myrtle chain,
And three rich years of youth consum'd in vain.
My wishes, lull'd with soft inglorious dreams,
Forgot the patriot's and the sage's themes:
Through each Elysian vale and fairy grove,
Through all the enchanted paradise of love,
Misled by sickly hope's deceitful flame,
Averse to action, and renouncing fame.

At last the visionary scenes decay,
My eyes, exulting, bless the new-born day,
Whose faithful beams detect the dangerous road
In which my heedless feet securely trod,
And strip the phantoms of their lying charms
That lur'd my soul from Wisdom's peaceful arms.

For silver streams and banks bespread with flowers,
For mossy couches and harmonious bowers,
Lo! barren heaths appear, and pathless woods,
And rocks hung dreadful o'er unfathom'd floods:
For openness of heart, for tender smiles,
Looks fraught with love, and wrath-disarming wiles;
Lo! sullen Spite, and perjur'd Lust of Gain,
And cruel Pride, and crueller Disdain;
Lo! cordial Faith to idiot airs refin'd,
Now coolly civil, now transporting kind.
For graceful Ease, lo! Affectation walks;
And dull Half-sense, for Wit and Wisdom talks.
New to each hour what low delight succeeds,
What precious furniture of hearts and heads!
By nought their prudence, but by getting, known,
And all their courage in deceiving shown.

See next what plagues attend the lover's state,
What frightful forms of Terror, Scorn, and Hate!
See burning Fury heaven and earth defy!
See Dumb Despair in icy fetters lie!
See black Suspicion bend his gloomy brow,
The hideous image of himself to view!
And fond Belief, with all a lover's flame,
Sink in those arms that point his head with shame!
There wan Dejection, faltering as he goes,
In shades and silence vainly seeks repose;
Musing through pathless wilds, consumes the day,
Then lost in darkness weeps the hours away.
Here the gay crowd of Luxury advance,
Some touch the lyre, and others urge the dance;
On every head the rosy garland glows,
In every hand the golden goblet flows
The Syren views them with exulting eyes,
And laughs at bashful Virtue as she flies.
But see behind, where Scorn and Want appear,
The grave remonstrance and the witty sneer;
See fell Remorse in action, prompt to dart
Her snaky poison through the conscious heart;
And Sloth to cancel, with oblivious shame,
The fair memorial of recording Fame.

Are these delights that one would wish to gain?
Is this the Elysium of a sober brain?
To wait for happiness in female smiles,
Bear all her scorn, be caught with all her wiles,
With prayers, with bribes, with lies, her pity crave,
Bless her hard bonds, and boast to be her slave;
To feel, for trifles, a distracting train
Of hopes and terrors equally in vain;
This hour to tremble, and the next to glow,
Can Pride, can Sense, can Reason, stoop so low?
When Virtue, at an easier price, displays
The sacred wreaths of honourable praise;
When Wisdom utters her divine decree,
To laugh at pompous Folly, and be free.

I bid adieu, then, to these woful scenes;
I bid adieu to all the sex of queens;
Adieu to every suffering, simple soul,
That lets a woman's will his ease control.
There laugh, ye witty; and rebuke, ye grave!
For me, I scorn to boast that I'm a slave.
I bid the whining brotherhood be gone:
Joy to my heart! my wishes are my own!
Farewell the female heaven, the female hell;
To the great God of Love a glad farewell.
Is this the triumph of thy awful name?
Are these the splendid hopes that urg'd thy aim,
When first my bosom own'd thy haughty sway?
When thus Minerva heard thee boasting, say,
“Go, martial maid, elsewhere thy arts employ,
Nor hope to shelter that devoted boy,
Go teach the solemn sons of Care and Age,
The pensive statesman, and the midnight sage:
The young with me must other lessons prove,
Youth calls for Pleasure, Pleasure calls for Love.
Behold, his heart thy grave advice disdains;
Behold, I bind him in eternal chains.”
Alas! great Love, how idle was the boast!
Thy chains are broken, and thy lessons lost;
Thy wilful rage has tir'd my suffering heart,
And passion, reason, forc'd thee to depart.
But wherefore dost thou linger on thy way?
Why vainly search for some pretence to stay,
When crowds of vassals court thy pleasing yoke,
And countless victims bow them to the stroke?
Lo! round thy shrine a thousand youths advance,
Warm with the gentle ardours of romance;
Each longs to assert thy cause with feats of arms,
And make the world confess Dulcinea's charms.

Ten thousand girls with flowery chaplets crown'd,
To groves and streams thy tender triumph sound:
Each bids the stream in murmurs speak her flame,
Each calls the grove to sigh her shepherd's name.
But, if thy pride such easy honour scorn,
If nobler trophies must thy toil adorn,
Behold yon flowery antiquated maid
Bright in the bloom of threescore years display'd;
Her shalt thou bind in thy delightful chains,
And thrill with gentle pangs her wither'd veins,
Her frosty cheek with crimson blushes dye,
With dreams of rapture melt her maudlin eye.

Turn then thy labours to the servile crowd,
Entice the wary, and control the proud;
Make the sad miser his best gains forego,
The solemn statesman sigh to be a beau,
The bold coquette with fondest passions burn,
The Bacchanalian o'er his bottle mourn;
And that chief glory of thy power maintain,
“To poise ambition in a female brain.”
Be these thy triumphs; but no more presume
That my rebellious heart will yield thee room:
I know thy puny force, thy simple wiles;
I break triumphant through thy flimsy toils;
I see thy dying lamp's last languid glow,
Thy arrows blunted and unbrac'd thy bow.
I feel diviner fires my breast inflame,
To active science, and ingenuous fame;
Resume the paths my earliest choice began,
And lose, with pride, the lover in the man.",Elegy

They beare most blows which come to part the fray. 
France in her lunatique giddines did hate 
Ever our men, yea and our God of late; 
Yet she relyes upon our Angels well, 
Which nere returne; no more than they which fell. 
Sick Ireland is with a strange warr possest 
Like to an Ague; now raging, now at rest; 
Which time will cure: yet it must doe her good 
If she were purg'd, and her head vayne let blood. 
And Midas joyes our Spanish journeys give, 
We touch all gold, but find no food to live. 
And I should be in the hott parching clime, 
To dust and ashes turn'd before my time. 
To mew me in a Ship, is to inthrall 
Mee in a prison, that weare like to fall; 
Or in a Cloyster; save that there men dwell 
In a calme heaven, here in a swaggering hell. 
Long voyages are long consumptions, 
And ships are carts for executions. 
Yea they are Deaths; Is't not all one to flye 
Into an other World, as t'is to dye? 
Here lett mee warr; in these armes lett mee lye; 
Here lett mee parle, batter, bleede, and dye. 
Thyne armes imprison me, and myne armes thee, 
Thy hart thy ransome is, take myne for mee. 
Other men war that they their rest may gayne; 
But wee will rest that wee may fight agayne. 
Those warrs the ignorant, these th'experienc'd love, 
There wee are alwayes under, here above. 
There Engins farr off breed a just true feare, 
Neere thrusts, pikes, stabs, yea bullets hurt not here. 
There lyes are wrongs; here safe uprightly ly; 
Tltere men kill men, we'will make one by and by, 
Thou nothing; I not halfe so much shall do 
In these Warrs, as they may which from us two 
Shall spring. Thousands wee see which travaile not 
To warrs; But stay swords, armes, and shott 
To make at home; And shall not I do then 
More glorious service, staying to make men?",Elegy
55,Friedrich Schiller,"Mournful groans, as when a tempest lowers,
 Echo from the dreary house of woe;
Death-notes rise from yonder minster's towers!
 Bearing out a youth, they slowly go;
Yes! a youth--unripe yet for the bier,
 Gathered in the spring-time of his days,
Thrilling yet with pulses strong and clear,
 With the flame that in his bright eye plays--
Yes, a son--the idol of his mother,
 (Oh, her mournful sigh shows that too well!)
Yes! my bosom-friend,--alas my brother!--
 Up! each man the sad procession swell!

Do ye boast, ye pines, so gray and old,
 Storms to brave, with thunderbolts to sport?
And, ye hills, that ye the heavens uphold?
 And, ye heavens, that ye the suns support!
Boasts the graybeard, who on haughty deeds
 As on billows, seeks perfection's height?
Boasts the hero, whom his prowess leads
 Up to future glory's temple bright!
If the gnawing worms the floweret blast,
 Who can madly think he'll ne'er decay?
Who above, below, can hope to last,
 If the young man's life thus fleets away?

Joyously his days of youth so glad
Danced along, in rosy garb beclad,
 And the world, the world was then so sweet!
And how kindly, how enchantingly
Smiled the future,--with what golden eye
 Did life's paradise his moments greet!
While the tear his mother's eye escaped,
Under him the realm of shadows gaped
 And the fates his thread began to sever,--
Earth and Heaven then vanished from his sight.
From the grave-thought shrank he in affright--
 Sweet the world is to the dying ever!

Dumb and deaf 'tis in that narrow place,
 Deep the slumbers of the buried one!
Brother! Ah, in ever-slackening race
 All thy hopes their circuit cease to run!
Sunbeams oft thy native hill still lave,
 But their glow thou never more canst feel;
O'er its flowers the zephyr's pinions wave,
 O'er thine ear its murmur ne'er can steal;
Love will never tinge thine eye with gold,
 Never wilt thou embrace thy blooming bride,
Not e'en though our tears in torrents rolled--
 Death must now thine eye forever hide!

Yet 'tis well!--for precious is the rest,
 In that narrow house the sleep is calm;
There, with rapture sorrow leaves the breast,--
 Man's afflictions there no longer harm.
Slander now may wildly rave o'er thee,
 And temptation vomit poison fell,
O'er the wrangle on the Pharisee,
 Murderous bigots banish thee to hell!
Rogues beneath apostle-masks may leer,
 And the bastard child of justice play,
As it were with dice, with mankind here,
 And so on, until the judgment day!

O'er thee fortune still may juggle on,
 For her minions blindly look around,--
Man now totter on his staggering throne,
 And in dreary puddles now be found!
Blest art thou, within thy narrow cell!
 To this stir of tragi-comedy,
To these fortune-waves that madly swell,
 To this vain and childish lottery,
To this busy crowd effecting naught,
 To this rest with labor teeming o'er,
Brother!--to this heaven with devils--fraught,
 Now thine eyes have closed forevermore.

Fare thee well, oh, thou to memory dear,
 By our blessings lulled to slumbers sweet!
Sleep on calmly in thy prison drear,--
 Sleep on calmly till again we meet!
Till the loud Almighty trumpet sounds,
 Echoing through these corpse-encumbered hills,
Till God's storm-wind, bursting through the bounds
 Placed by death, with life those corpses fills--
Till, impregnate with Jehovah's blast,
 Graves bring forth, and at His menace dread,
In the smoke of planets melting fast,
 Once again the tombs give up their dead!

Not in worlds, as dreamed of by the wise,
 Not in heavens, as sung in poet's song,
Not in e'en the people's paradise--
 Yet we shall o'ertake thee, and ere long.
Is that true which cheered the pilgrim's gloom?
 Is it true that thoughts can yonder be
True, that virtue guides us o'er the tomb?
 That 'tis more than empty phantasy?
All these riddles are to thee unveiled!
 Truth thy soul ecstatic now drinks up,
Truth in radiance thousandfold exhaled
 From the mighty Father's blissful cup.

Dark and silent bearers draw, then, nigh!
 To the slayer serve the feast the while!
Cease, ye mourners, cease your wailing cry!
 Dust on dust upon the body pile!
Where's the man who God to tempt presumes?
 Where the eye that through the gulf can see?
Holy, holy, holy art thou, God of tombs!
 We, with awful trembling, worship Thee!
Dust may back to native dust be ground,
 From its crumbling house the spirit fly,
And the storm its ashes strew around,--
 But its love, its love shall never die!",Elegy
56,Subbaraman N V,"You were my constant companion
You were my faultless friend
You were my unfailing guide
You were my timely whip! 

You were thick and you were thin
You saw me in my thick and thin! 

You were fed once a month
You fed me all through the month! 

You helped many a friend of mine
You rushed to the unknown strangers too! 

You have seen my days of light and dark
You have warned me lest I went astray! 

Now you are gone where I do not know! 

Is it I could not satisfy your thirst
Is it you could not see me burst
Is it because I did not obey your command
Is it because I did not satisfy your demand? 

How nice you were to see
How lovely you were to me
How good you were to touch
How kind you were as such!

You taught me sense of thrift
You taught me nature of men
You taught me joy of life

Others by wills give legacies, but I

58,David Herbert Lawrence,"Since I lost you, my darling, the sky has come near,
And I am of it, the small sharp stars are quite near,
The white moon going among them like a white bird among snow-berries,
And the sound of her gently rustling in heaven like a bird I hear.
 
And I am willing to come to you now, my dear,
As a pigeon lets itself off from a cathedral dome  
To be lost in the haze of the sky, I would like to come,  
And be lost out of sight with you, and be gone like foam.

For I am tired, my dear, and if I could lift my feet,  
My tenacious feet from off the dome of the earth
To fall like a breath within the breathing wind  
Where you are lost, what rest, my love, what rest!",Elegy
59,Stephen Vincent Benet,"(For G. H.) 

Say, does that stupid earth 
Where they have laid her, 
Bind still her sullen mirth, 
Mirth which betrayed her? 
Do the lush grasses hold, 
Greenly and glad, 
That brittle-perfect gold 
She alone had? 

Smugly the common crew, 
Over their knitting, 
Mourn her -- as butchers do 
Sheep-throats they're slitting! 
She was my enemy, 
One of the best of them. 
Would she come back to me, 
God damn the rest of them! 

Damn them, the flabby, fat, 
Sleek little darlings! 
We gave them tit for tat, 
Snarlings for snarlings! 
Squashy pomposities, 
Shocked at our violence, 
Let not one tactful hiss 
Break her new silence! 

Maids of antiquity, 
Look well upon her; 
Ice was her chastity, 
Spotless her honor. 
Neighbors, with breasts of snow, 
Dames of much virtue, 
How she could flame and glow! 
Lord, how she hurt you! 

She was a woman, and 
Tender -- at times!

61,Jonathan Swift,"Well; 'tis as Bickerstaff has guess'd,
Though we all took it for a jest:
Partridge is dead; nay more, he died
Ere he could prove the good 'squire lied.
Strange, an astrologer should die
Without one wonder in the sky!
Not one of his crony stars
To pay their duty at his hearse!
No meteor, no eclipse appear'd!
No comet with a flaming beard!
The sun has rose, and gone to bed,
Just as if Partridge were not dead;
Nor hid himself behind the moon
To make a dreadful night at noon.
He at fit periods walks through Aries,
Howe'er our earthly motion varies;
And twice a year he'll cut the equator,
As if there had been no such matter.
Some wits have wonder'd what analogy
There is 'twixt cobbling and astrology;
How Partridge made his optics rise
From a shoe-sole to reach the skies.
A list the cobbler's temples ties,
To keep the hair out of his eyes;
From whence 'tis plain, the diadem
That princes wear derives from them:
And therefore crowns are nowadays
Adorn'd with golden stars and rays:
Which plainly shows the near alliance
'Twixt cobbling and the planets science.
Besides, that slow-pac'd sign Bootes,
As 'tis miscall'd, we know not who 'tis:
But Partridge ended all disputes;
He knew his trade, and call'd it boots.
The horned moon, which heretofore
Upon their shoes the Romans wore,
Whose wideness kept their toes from corns,
And whence we claim our shoeing-horns,
Shows how the art of cobbling bears
A near resemblance to the spheres.
A scrap of parchment hung by geometry
(A great refinement in barometry)
Can, like the stars, foretell the weather;
And what is parchment else but leather?
Which an astrologer might use
Either for almanacs or shoes.
Thus Partridge by his wit and parts
At once did practise both these arts:
And as the boding owl (or rather
The bat, because her wings are leather)
Steals from her private cell by night,
And flies about the candle-light;
So learned Partridge could as well
Creep in the dark from leathern cell,
And in his fancy fly as far
To peep upon a twinkling star.
Besides, he could confound the spheres,
And set the planets by the ears;
To show his skill, he Mars could join
To Venus in aspect malign;
Then call in Mercury for aid,
And cure the wounds that Venus made.
Great scholars have in Lucian read,
When Philip king of Greece was dead,
His soul and spirit did divide,
And each part took a different side:
One rose a star; the other fell
Beneath, and mended shoes in hell.
Thus Partridge still shines in each art,
The cobbling and star-gazing part,
And is install'd as good a star
As any of the Caesars are.
Triumphant star! some pity show
On cobblers militant below,
Whom roguish boys in stormy nights
Torment by pissing out their lights,
Or thro' a chink convey their smoke
Inclos'd artificers to choke.
Thou, high exalted in thy sphere,
May'st follow still thy calling there.
To thee the Bull will lend his hide,
By Phoebus newly tann'd and dry'd:
For thee they Argo's hulk will tax,
And scrape her pitchy sides for wax;
Then Ariadne kindly lends
Her braided hair to make thee ends;
The point of Sagittarius' dart
Turns to an awl by heav'nly art;
And Vulcan, wheedled by his wife,
Will forge for thee a paring-knife.
For want of room by Virgo's side,
She'll strain a point, and sit astride,
To take thee kindly in between;
And then the signs will be thirteen.


THE EPITAPH.

Here, five foot deep, lies on his back
A cobbler, star-monger, and quack;
Who to the stars in pure good-will
Does to his best look upward still.
Weep, all you customers that use
His pills, his almanacs, or shoes:
And you that did your fortunes seek,
Step to his grave but once a week:
This earth, which bears his body's print,
You'll find has so much virtue in't,
That I durst pawn my ears 't will tell
Whate'er concerns you full as well,
In physic, stolen goods, or love,
As he himself could, when above.",Elegy
62,Mary Darby Robinson,"NEAR yon bleak mountain's dizzy height, 
That hangs o'er AVON's silent wave; 
By the pale Crescent's glimm'ring light, 
I sought LORENZO's lonely grave. 

O'er the long grass the silv'ry dew, 
Soft Twilight's tears spontaneous shone; 
And the dank bough of baneful yew 
Supply'd the place of sculptured stone. 

Oft, as my trembling steps drew near, 
The aëry voice of FANCY gave 
The plaint of GENIUS to mine ear, 
That, lingering, murmur'd on his grave. 

""Cold is that heart, where honour glow'd, 
And Friendship's flame sublimely shone, 
And clos'd that eye where Pity flow'd, 
For ev'ry suff'ring but HIS OWN. 

""That form where youth and grace conspir'd, 
To captivate admiring eyes, 
No more belov'd, no more admir'd, 
A torpid mass neglected lies. 

""Mute is the music of that tongue, 
Once tuneful as the voice of love, 
When ORPHEUS, by his magic song, 
Taught trees, and flinty rocks to move. 

""Oft shall the pensive MUSE be found, 
Sprinkling with flow'rs his mould'ring clay; 
While soft-eyed SORROW wand'ring round, 
Shall pluck intruding weeds away."" 

Sad victim of the sordid mind, 
That doom'd THEE to an early grave; 
Ne'er shall HER breast that pity find, 
Which thy forgiveness nobly gave! 

Thou, who, when SORROW'S icy hand 
Forbad the healthsome pulse to flow, 
Obedient to HER stern command, 
With meek submission bow'd thee low! 

And when thy faded cheek proclaim'd 
The thorn that rankled in thy breast, 
Thy steady soul that pride maintain'd, 
Which marks the godlike mind distress'd! 

Nor was thy mental strength subdu'd, 
When HOPE's last ling'ring shadows fled, 
Unchang'd, thy dauntless spirit view'd 
The dreary confines of the dead! 

And when thy penetrating mind, 
Life's thorny maze presum'd to scan, 
In ev'ry path condemn'd to find 
""The low ingratitude of man."" 

Indignant would'st thou turn away, 
And smiling raise thy languid eye, 
And oft thy feeble voice would say, 
""TO ME 'TIS HAPPINESS TO DIE.""

And tho' thy FRIEND, I with skilful art, 
To heal thy woes, each balm apply'd; 
Tho' the fine feelings of his heart, 
Nor cost nor studious care deny'd! 

He saw the fatal hour draw near, 
He saw THEE fading to the grave; 
He gave his last kind gift, A TEAR, 
And mourn'd the worth he could not save. 

Nor could the ruthless breath of FATE 
Snatch from thy grave the tender sigh; 
Nor a relentless monster's hate 
Impede thy passage to the sky. 

And tho' no kindred tears were shed, 
No tribute to thy memory giv'n; 
Sublime in death, thy spirit fled, 
To seek its best reward IN HEAVEN!",Elegy
63,John Donne,"Upon the Loss of His Mistress’s Chain, for Which He Made Satisfaction

NOT that in colour it was like thy hair,
For armlets of that thou mayst let me wear; 
Nor that thy hand it oft embraced and kiss'd,
For so it had that good, which oft I miss'd; 
Nor for that silly old morality,
That, as these links were knit, our love should be,
Mourn I that I thy sevenfold chain have lost; 
Nor for the luck sake; but the bitter cost.
O, shall twelve righteous angels, which as yet
No leaven of vile solder did admit; 
Nor yet by any way have stray'd or gone
From the first state of their creation; 
Angels, which heaven commanded to provide
All things to me, and be my faithful guide; 
To gain new friends, to appease great enemies; 
To comfort my soul, when I lie or rise; 
Shall these twelve innocents, by thy severe
Sentence, dread judge, my sin's great burden bear? 
Shall they be damn'd, and in the furnace thrown,
And punish'd for offenses not their own? 
They save not me, they do not ease my pains,
When in that hell they're burnt and tied in chains.
Were they but crowns of France, I carèd not,
For most of these their country's natural rot,
I think, possesseth; they come here to us
So pale, so lame, so lean, so ruinous.
And howsoe'er French kings most Christian be,
Their crowns are circumcised most Jewishly.
Or were they Spanish stamps, still travelling,
That are become as Catholic as their king; 
These unlick'd bear-whelps, unfiled pistolets,
That—more than cannon shot—avails or lets; 
Which, negligently left unrounded, look
Like many-angled figures in the book
Of some great conjurer that would enforce
Nature, so these do justice, from her course; 
Which, as the soul quickens head, feet and heart,
As streams, like veins, run through th' earth's every part,
Visit all countries, and have slily made
Gorgeous France, ruin'd, ragged and decay'd,
Scotland, which knew no state, proud in one day,
And mangled seventeen-headed Belgia.
Or were it such gold as that wherewithal
Almighty chemics, from each mineral
Having by subtle fire a soul out-pull'd,
Are dirtily and desperately gull'd; 
I would not spit to quench the fire they're in,
For they are guilty of much heinous sin.
But shall my harmless angels perish? Shall
I lose my guard, my ease, my food, my all? 
Much hope which they would nourish will be dead.
Much of my able youth, and lustihead
Will vanish; if thou love, let them alone,
For thou wilt love me less when they are gone; 
And be content that some loud squeaking crier,
Well-pleas'd with one lean threadbare groat, for hire,
May like a devil roar through every street,
And gall the finder's conscience, if he meet.
Or let me creep to some dread conjurer,
That with fantastic schemes fills full much paper; 
Which hath divided heaven in tenements,
And with whores, thieves, and murderers stuff'd his rents
So full, that though he pass them all in sin,
He leaves himself no room to enter in.
But if, when all his art and time is spent,
He say 'twill ne'er be found; yet be content; 
Receive from him that doom ungrudgingly,
Because he is the mouth of destiny.
Thou say'st, alas! the gold doth still remain,
Though it be changed, and put into a chain.
So in the first fallen angels resteth still
Wisdom and knowledge, but 'tis turn'd to ill; 
As these should do good works, and should provide
Necessities; but now must nurse thy pride.
And they are still bad angels; mine are none; 
For form gives being, and their form is gone.
Pity these angels yet; their dignities
Pass Virtues, Powers, and Principalities.
But thou art resolute; thy will be done; 
Yet with such anguish, as her only son
The mother in the hungry grave doth lay,
Unto the fire these martyrs I betray.
Good souls—for you give life to everything—
Good angels—for good messages you bring—
Destined you might have been to such an one,
As would have loved and worshipp'd you alone; 
One that would suffer hunger, nakedness,
Yea death, ere he would make your number less; 
But, I am guilty of your sad decay; 
May your few fellows longer with me stay.
But O! thou wretched finder whom I hate
So, that I almost pity thy estate,
Gold being the heaviest metal amongst all,
May my most heavy curse upon thee fall.
Here fetter'd, manacled, and hang'd in chains,
First mayst thou be; then chain'd to hellish pains; 
Or be with foreign gold bribed to betray
Thy country, and fail both of it and thy pay.
May the next thing thou stoop'st to reach, contain
Poison, whose nimble fume rot thy moist brain; 
Or libels, or some interdicted thing,
Which negligently kept thy ruin bring.
Lust-bred diseases rot thee; and dwell with thee
Itching desire, and no ability.
May all the evils that gold ever wrought; 
All mischief that all devils ever thought; 
Want after plenty, poor and gouty age,
The plagues of travellers, love, marriage
Afflict thee, and at thy life's last moment,
May thy swollen sins themselves to thee present.
But, I forgive; repent thee, honest man! 
Gold is restorative; restore it then:
But if from it thou be'st loth to depart,
Because 'tis cordial, would 'twere at thy heart.",Elegy
64,Charlotte Smith,"'DARK gathering clouds involve the threatening skies,
The sea heaves conscious of the impending gloom,
Deep, hollow murmurs from the cliffs arise;
They come--the Spirits of the Tempest come!

'Oh! may such terrors mark the approaching night
As reign'd on that these streaming eyes deplore!
Flash, ye red fires of heaven, with fatal light,
And with conflicting winds ye waters roar!
'Loud and more loud, ye foaming billows, burst!
Ye warring elements, more fiercely rave!
Till the wide waves o'erwhelm the spot accurst

No longer such as when in happier days
He gave the enchanted hours--to me and love.
'Such, as when daring the enchafed sea,
And courting dangerous toil, he often said
That every peril, one soft smile from me,
One sigh of speechless tenderness o'erpaid.

And seem to say--Ah, wretch! delay no more,
But come, unhappy mourner--meet me here.
'Yet, powerful Fancy, bid the phantom stay,
Still let me hear him!--'Tis already past;
Along the waves his shadow glides away,
I lose his voice amid the deafening blast.
'Ah, wild delusion, born of frantic pain!

My tears, my anguish, my despair are vain,
The insatiate ocean gives not up its dead.
' 'Tis not his voice! Hark! the deep thunders roll;
Upheaves the ground; the rocky barriers fail;
Approach, ye horrors that delight my soul,
Despair, and Death, and Desolation, hail!'

Rise o'er the land, and with resistless sweep
Tear from its base the proud aggressor's tomb,
And bear the injured to eternal sleep.",Elegy
65,John Donne,"COME Fates ; I fear you not ! All whom I owe

But Chance from you all sovereignty hath got ;
Love woundeth none but those whom Death dares not ;
True if you were, and just in equity,
I should have vanquish'd her, as you did me ;
Else lovers should not brave Death's pains, and live ;
But 'tis a rule, “ Death comes not to relieve.”
Or, pale and wan Death's terrors, are they laid
So deep in lovers, they make Death afraid ?
Or—the least comfort—have I company ?
O'ercame she Fates, Love, Death, as well as me ?
Yes, Fates do silk unto her distaff pay,
For ransom, which tax they on us do lay.
Love gives her youth—which is the reason why
Youths, for her sake, some wither and some die.
Poor Death can nothing give ; yet, for her sake,
Still in her turn, he doth a lover take.
And if Death should prove false, she fears him not ;
Our Muses, to redeem her, she hath got.

A food, whose taste hath made me pine away.
Dives, when thou saw'st bliss, and craved'st to touch
A drop of water, thy great pains were such.

And my sighs weary, groans are all my rent.
Unable longer to endure the pain,
They break like thunder, and do bring down rain.
Thus till dry tear solder my eye, I weep ;
And then, I dream, how you securely sleep,
And in your dreams do laugh at me. I hate,
And pray Love all may ; he pities my state,
But says, I therein no revenge shall find ;
The sun would shine, though all the world were blind.
Yet, to try my hate, Love show'd me your tear ;
And I had died, had not your smile been there.
Your frown undoes me ; your smile is my wealth ;
And as you please to look, I have my health.
Methought, Love pitying me, when he saw this,
Gave me your hands, the backs and palms to kiss.
That cured me not, but to bear pain gave strength ;
And what is lost in force, is took in length.
I call'd on Love again, who fear'd you so,
That his compassion still proved greater woe ;
For, then I dream'd I was in bed with you,
But durst not feel, for fear it should not be true.
This merits not your anger, had it been ;
The queen of chastity was naked seen ;
And in bed not to feel, the pain I took,
Was more than for Actæon not to look ;
And that breast which lay ope, I did not know,
But for the clearness, from a lump of snow ;
Nor that sweet teat which on the top it bore
From the rose-bud which for my sake you wore.
These griefs to issue forth, by verse I prove ;
Or turn their course by travel and new love.
All would not do ; the best at last I tried ;
Unable longer to hold out, I died.
And then I found I lost life, death by flying ;
Who hundreds live, are but so long in dying.
Charon did let me pass ; I'll him requite.
To mark the groves or shades wrongs my delight ;
I'll speak but of those ghosts I found alone,
Those thousand ghosts, whereof myself made one,
All images of thee ; I asked them why ?
The judge told me, all they for thee did die,
And therefore had for their Elysian bliss,
In one another their own loves to kiss.
O here I miss'd not blissh, but being dead ;
For lo ! I dreamt, I dreamt, and waking said,
“ Heaven, if who are in thee there must dwell,
How is't I now was there, and now I fell ?”",Elegy
66,Amelia Opie,"Too heedless friend, why thus augment the flame
That glows resistless in my beating breast?
Why with thy praises grace his fatal name,
Who robs thy Emma's hapless heart of rest?

Why needest thou dwell on Henry's graceful ease;
Why praise the timid worth his glance reveals;
Why speak enraptured of his power to please,
Whose power to wound my aching bosom feels?

Say not, ""That gentle voice was formed for love,""
Nor in his eyes such sweet expression see;
Say not, that tenderness those glances prove,
Which never fix with tenderness on me.

Too well my Henry's charms I've numbered o'er,
And thus to end the fond survey is mine:
His heart will own some brighter fair one's power;
Think not, lost Emma, he can e'er be thine.

Yet why despair? Though Beauty's boasted rose
On others' cheeks in livelier colours shine,
The tender heart that in my bosom glows
The palm of fondness will to none resign.

Though brighter radiance beams in others' eyes,
By shape, by colour formed the soul to steal;
If Love's expression Henry's heart can prize,
Then, Henry's heart the power of mine must feel.

Yet vain the hope: ""Fond maid, thy love suppress,""
Calm Reason cries; ""go, learn to check the sigh:
But, if resolved to love in rash excess,
Seek out some lonely shade, despair, and die!""

Then, Laura, bid to Henry's praise farewel!
Forget his merit, and my hopeless flame;
On the dear theme no more ill-judging dwell,
And from thy memory blot his fatal name.

But if I urge this plaintive prayer in vain,
Bid execrations on that name attend;
And him, my Laura, view with cold disdain,
Who sees unmoved the sorrows of thy friend.

Say, such the scorn, the pride of Henry's breast,
It cannot Love's endearing softness share,
Say, vice degrades....Hold! slight my wild request,
Nor by such calumny my fury dare.

No....from my frantic wishes still appeal,
Declare that Henry is from error free;
Or the keen hate for him I bade thee feel,
My wayward heart will learn to feel for thee.",Elegy
67,Mary Darby Robinson,"""With female Fairies will thy tomb be haunted
""And worms will not come to thee."" SHAKSPERE. 


WHEN from Day's closing eye the lucid tears
Fall lightly on the bending lily's head;
When o'er the blushing sky night's curtains spread, 
And the tall mountain's summit scarce appears;
When languid Evening, sinking to repose,
Her filmy mantle o'er the landscape throws; 
Of THEE I'll sing; and as the mournful song 
Glides in slow numbers the dark woods among; 
My wand'ring steps shall seek the lonely shade, 
Where all thy virtues, all thy griefs are laid! 

Yes, hopeless suff'rer, friendless and forlorn,
Sweet victim of love's power; the silent tear
Shall oft at twilight's close, and glimm'ring morn
Gem the pale primrose that adorns thy bier, 
And as the balmy dew ascends to heaven, 
Thy crime shall steal away, thy frailty be forgiv'n. 

Oft by the moon's wan beam the love-lorn maid,
Led by soft SYMPATHY, shall stroll along;
Oft shall she listen in the Lime-tree's * shade,
Her cold blood freezing at the night-owl's song:
Or, when she hears the death-bell's solemn sound,
Her light steps echoing o'er the hollow ground;
Oft shall the trickling tear adorn her cheek,
Thy pow'r, O SENSIBILITY ! in magic charms to speak! 

For the poor PILGRIM, doom'd afar to roam
From the dear comforts of his native home,
A glitt'ring star puts forth a silv'ry ray,
Soothes his sad heart, and marks his tedious way;
The short-liv'd radiance cheers the gloom of night,
And decks Heaven's murky dome with transitory light. 

So from the mournful CHARLOTTE's dark-orb'd lids,
The sainted tear of pitying VIRTUE flows; 
And the last boon, the ""churlish priest"" forbids,
On thy lone grave the sacred drop bestows;
There shall the sparkling dews of Evening shine,
AND HEAVEN'S OWN INCENSE CONSECRATE THE SHRINE.",Elegy
68,Robert Burns,"Lament in rhyme, lament in prose, 
Wi' saut tears tricklin down your nose; 
Our bardie's fate is at a close, 
Past a' remead!

It's no the loss o' warl's gear, 
That could sae bitter draw the tear, 
Or mak our bardie, dowie, wear

He's lost a friend an' neebor dear 
In Mailie dead.

69,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,"Near the lone pile with ivy overspread,
Fast by the rivulet's sleep-persuading sound,
Where 'sleeps the moonlight' on yon verdant bed--
O humbly press that consecrated ground!

For there does Edmund rest, the learned swain!
And there his spirit most delights to rove:
Young Edmund! famed for each harmonious strain,
And the sore wounds of ill-requited love.

Like some tall tree that spreads its branches wide,
And loads the west wind with its soft perfume,
His manhood blossomed: till the faithless pride
Of fair Matilda sank him to the tomb.

But soon did righteous Heaven her guilt pursue!
Where'er with wildered step she wandered pale,
Still Edmund's image rose to blast her view,
Still Edmund's voice accused her in each gale.

With keen regret, and conscious guilt's alarms,
Amid the pomp of affluence she pined;
Nor all that lured her faith from Edmund's arms
Could lull the wakeful horror of her mind.

Go, Traveller! tell the tale with sorrow fraught:
Some tearful maid perchance, or blooming youth,
May hold it in remembrance; and be taught
That riches cannot pay for Love or Truth.",Elegy
70,John Dryden,"'Twas on a joyless and a gloomy morn, 
Wet was the grass, and hung with pearls the thorn, 
When Damon, who designed to pass the day 
With hounds and horns, and chase the flying prey, 
Rose early from his bed; but soon he found 
The welkin pitched with sullen clouds around, 
An eastern wind, and dew upon the ground. 
Thus while he stood, and sighing did survey 
The fields, and curst the ill omens of the day, 
He saw Menalcas come with heavy pace: 
Wet were his eyes, and cheerless was his face: 
He wrung his hands, distracted with his care, 
And sent his voice before him from afar. 
“Return,” he cried, “return, unhappy swain, 
The spongy clouds are filled with gathering rain: 
The promise of the day not only crossed, 
But even the spring, the spring itself is lost. 
Amyntas—oh!”—he could not speak the rest, 
Nor needed, for presaging Damon guessed. 
Equal with heaven young Damon loved the boy, 
The boast of nature, both his parents' joy. 
His graceful form revolving in his mind; 
So great a genius, and a soul so kind, 
Gave sad assurance that his fears were true; 
Too well the envy of the gods he knew: 
For when their gifts too lavishly are placed, 
Soon they repent, and will not make them last. 
For sure it was too bountiful a dole, 
The mother's features, and the father's soul. 
Then thus he cried:—“The morn bespoke the news; 
The morning did her cheerful light diffuse; 
But see how suddenly she changed her face, 
And brought on clouds and rain, the day's disgrace; 
Just such, Amyntas, was thy promised race. 
What charms adorned thy youth, where nature smiled, 
And more than man was given us in a child! 
His infancy was ripe; a soul sublime 
In years so tender that prevented time: 
Heaven gave him all at once; then snatched away, 
Ere mortals all his beauties could survey; 
Just like the flower that buds and withers in a day.” 

MENALCAS.
The mother, lovely, though with grief opprest, 
Reclined his dying head upon her breast. 
The mournful family stood all around; 
One groan was heard, one universal sound: 
All were in floods of tears and endless sorrow drowned. 
So dire a sadness sat on every look, 
Even Death repented he had given the stroke. 
He grieved his fatal work had been ordained, 
But promised length of life to those who yet remained. 
The mother's and her eldest daughter's grace, 
It seems, had bribed him to prolong their space. 
The father bore it with undaunted soul, 
Like one who durst his destiny control; 
Yet with becoming grief he bore his part, 
Resigned his son, but not resigned his heart. 
Patient as Job; and may he live to see, 
Like him, a new increasing family! 

DAMON.
Such is my wish, and such my prophecy; 
For yet, my friend, the beauteous mould remains; 
Long may she exercise her fruitful pains! 
But, ah! with better hap, and bring a race 
More lasting, and endued with equal grace! 
Equal she may, but farther none can go; 
For he was all that was exact below. 

MENALCAS.
Damon, behold yon breaking purple cloud; 
Hear'st thou not hymns and songs divinely loud? 
There mounts Amyntas; the young cherubs play 
About their godlike mate, and sing him on his way. 
He cleaves the liquid air; behold, he flies, 
And every moment gains upon the skies. 
The new-come guest admires the ethereal state, 
The sapphire portal, and the golden gate; 
And now admitted in the shining throng, 
He shows the passport which he brought along. 
His passport is his innocence and grace, 
Well known to all the natives of the place. 
Now sing, ye joyful angels, and admire 
Your brother's voice that comes to mend your quire: 
Sing you, while endless tears our eyes bestow; 
For, like Amyntas, none is left below.",Elegy
71,James Thomson,"It was a sad, ay 'twas a sad farewell, 
I still afresh the pangs of parting feel; 
Against my breast my heart impatient beat, 
And in deep sighs bemoan'd its cruel fate; 
Thus with the object of my love to part, 
My life! my joy! 'twould rend a rocky heart. 
Where'er I turn myself, where'er I go, 
I meet the image of my lovely foe; 
With witching charms the phantom still appears, 
And with her wanton smiles insults my tears; 
Still haunts the places where we used to walk, 
And where with raptures oft I heard her talk: 
Those scenes I now with deepest sorrow view, 
And sighing bid to all delight adieu. 
While I my head upon this turf recline, 
Officious sun, in vain on me you shine; 
In vain unto the smiling fields I hie; 
In vain the flowery meads salute my eye; 
In vain the cheerful birds and shepherds sing, 
And with their carols make the valleys ring; 
Yea, all the pleasure that the country yield 
Can't me from sorrow for her absence shield; 
With divine pleasure books which one inspire, 
Yea, books themselves I do not now admire. 
But hark! methinks some pitying power I hear, 
This welcome message whisper in my ear: 
‘Forget thy groundless griefs, dejected swain, 
You and the nymph you love shall meet again; 
No more your muse shall sing such mournful lays, 
But bounteous heaven and your kind mistress praise.’",Elegy
72,Ben Jonson,"THOUGH beauty be the mark of praise, 
And yours of whom I sing be such 
As not the world can praise too much, 
Yet 'tis your Virtue now I raise. 

A virtue, like allay so gone 
Throughout your form as, though that move 
And draw and conquer all men's love, 
This subjects you to love of one. 

Wherein you triumph yet-because 
'Tis of your flesh, and that you use 
The noblest freedom, not to choose 
Against or faith or honour's laws. 

But who should less expect from you? 
In whom alone Love lives again: 
By whom he is restored to men, 
And kept and bred and brought up true. 

His falling temples you have rear'd, 
The wither'd garlands ta'en away; 
His altars kept from that decay 
That envy wish'd, and nature fear'd: 

And on them burn so chaste a flame, 
With so much loyalty's expense, 
As Love to acquit such excellence 
Is gone himself into your name. 

And you are he-the deity 
To whom all lovers are design'd 
That would their better objects find; 
Among which faithful troop am I- 

Who as an off'ring at your shrine 
Have sung this hymn, and here entreat 
One spark of your diviner heat 
To light upon a love of mine. 

Which if it kindle not, but scant 
Appear, and that to shortest view; 
Yet give me leave to adore in you 
What I in her am grieved to want!",Elegy
73,Percy Bysshe Shelley,"From the Greek of Moschus.

Ye Dorian woods and waves, lament aloud,--
Augment your tide, O streams, with fruitless tears,
For the beloved Bion is no more.
Let every tender herb and plant and flower,
From each dejected bud and drooping bloom, 
Shed dews of liquid sorrow, and with breath
Of melancholy sweetness on the wind
Diffuse its languid love; let roses blush,
Anemones grow paler for the loss
Their dells have known; and thou, O hyacinth, 
Utter thy legend now--yet more, dumb flower,
Than 'Ah! alas!'--thine is no common grief--
Bion the [sweetest singer] is no more.",Elegy

Newstead! fast-falling, once-resplendent dome!
Religion's shrine! repentant HENRY's pride!
Of warriors, monks, and dames the cloister'd tomb,
Whose pensive shades around thy ruins glide,
Hail to thy pile! more honour'd in thy fall
Than modern mansions in their pillar'd state;
Proudly majestic frowns thy vaulted hall, 
Scowling defiance on the blasts of fate.

No mail-clad serfs, obedient to their lord, 
In grim array the crimson cross demand;
Or gay assemble round the festive board 
Their chief's retainers, an immortal band:

Else might inspiting Fancy's magic eye 
Retrace their progress through the lapse of time,
Marking each ardent youth, ordaln'd to die,
A votive pilgrim in Judea's clime.

But not from thee, dark pile! departs the chief;
His feudal realm in other regions lay:
In thee the wounded conscience courts relief,
Retiring from the garish blare of day.

Yes! in thy gloomy cells and shades profound
The monk abjured a world he ne'er could view;
Or blood-stain'd guilt repenting solace found,
Or innocence from stern oppression flew.

A monarch bade thee from that wild arise,
Where Sherwood's outlaws once were wont to prowl;
And Superstition's crimes, of various dyes,
Sought shelter in the priest's protecting cowl.

Where now the grass exhales a murky dew,
The humid pail of life-extinguish'd clay,
In sainted fame the sacred fathers grew, 
Nor raised their pious voices but to pray.

Where now the bats their wavering wings extend
Soon as the gloaming spreads her waning shade,
The choir did oft their mingling vespers blend,
Or matin orisons to Mary pald.

Years roll on years; to ages, ages yield; 
Abbots to abbots, in a line, succeed;
Religion's charter their protecting shield, 
Till royal sacrilege their doom decreed,
One holy HENRY rear'd the Gothic walls, 
And bade the pious inmates rest in peace
Another HENRY the kind gift recalls, 
And bids devotion's hallow'd echos cease.

Vain is each threat or supplicating prayer; 
He drives them exiles from their blest abode,
To roam a dreary world in deep despair —
No friend, no home, no refuge, but their God.

Hark how the hall, resounding to the strain
Shakes with the martial music's novel din!
The heralds of a warrior's haughty reign, 
High crested banners wave thy wails within.

Of changing sentinels the distant hum, 
The mirth of feasts, the clang of burnish'd arms,
The braying trumpet and the hoarser drum,
Unite in concert with increased alarms.

An abbey once, a regal fortress now, 
Encircled by insulting rebel powers,
War's dread machines o'erhang thy threat'ning brow,
And dart destruction in sulphureous showers.

Ah vain defence! the hostile traitor's siege, 
Though oft repulsed, by guile o'er-comes the brave;
His thronging foes oppress the faithful liege,
Rebellion's reeking standards o'er him wave.

Not unavenged the raging baron yields; 
The blood of traitors smears the purple plain
Unconqu'r'd still, his falchion there he wields,
And days of glory yet for him remain.

Still in that hour the warrior wish'd to strew
Self-gather'd laurel on a self-sought grave;
But Charles' protecting genius hither flew, 
The monarch's friend, the monarch's hope, to save.

Trembling, she snatch'd him ftom th' unequal strife,
In other fields the torrent to repel; 
For nobler combats, here reservedhis life,
To lead the hand where godlike FALKLAND fell
From thee, poor pile! to lawless plunder given,
While dying groans their painful requiem sound,
Far different incense now ascends to heaven,
Such victims wallow on the gory ground.

There many a pale and ruthless robber's corse,
Noisome and ghast, defiles thy sacred sod;
O'er mingling man, and horse commix'd with horse,
Corruption's heap, the savage spoilers trod.

Graves, long with rank and sighing weeds o'erspread,
Ransack'd, resign perforce their mortal mould:
From ruffian fangs escape not e'en the dead,
Raked from repose in search of buried gold.

Hush'd is the harp, unstrung the warlike lyre'
The minstrel's palsied hand reclines in death; 
No more he strikes the quivering chords with fire,
Or sings the glories of the martial wreath.

At length the sated murderers, gorged with prey,
Retire: the clamour of the fight is o'er; 
Silence again resumes her awful sway, 
And sable Horror guards the massy door.

Here Desolation holds her dreary court:
What satellites declare her dismal reign! 
Shrieking their dirge, ill-omen'd birds resort,
To flit their vigils in the hoary fane. 

Soon a new morn's restoring beams dispel
The clouds of anarchy from Britain's skies;
The fierce usurper seeks his native hell, 
And Nature triumphs as the tyrant dies.

With storms she welcomes his expiring groans 
Whirlwinds, responsive, greet his labouring breath;
Earth shudders as her caves receive his bones,
Loathing the offering of so dark a death.

The legal ruler now resumes the helm, 
He guides through gentle seas the prow of state
Hope cheers, with wonted smiles, the peaceful realm,
And heals the bleeding wounds of wearied hate. 

The gloomy tenants, Newstead! of thy cells,
Howling, resign their violated nest; 
Again the master on his tenure dwells, 
Enjoy'd, from absence, with enraptured zest.

Vassals, within thy hospitable pale, 
Loudly carousing, bless their lord's return.
Culture again adorns the gladdening vale, 
And matrons, once lamenting, cease to mourn.

A thousand songs on tuneful echo float, 
Unwonted foliage mantles o'er the trees;
And hark! the horns proclalm a mellow note,
The hunters' cry hangs lengthening on the breeze.

Beneath their coursers' hoofs the valleys shake:
What fears, what anxious hopes attend the chase!
The dying stag seeks refuge in the lake;
Exulting shouts announce the finish'd race.

Ah happy days! too happy to endure! 
Such simple sports our plain forefathers knew
No splendid vices glitter'd to allure; 
Their joys were many, as their cares were few.

From these descending, sons to sires succeed
Time steals along, and Death uprears the dart;
Another chief impels the foaming steed, 
Another crowd pursue the panting hart.

Newstead! what saddening change of scene is thine!
Thy yawning arch betokens slow decay; 
The last and youngest of a noble line
Now holds thy mouldering turrets in his sway.

Deserted now, he scans thy gray worn towers;
Thy vaults, where dead of feudal ages sleep;
Thy cloisters, pervious to the wintry showers
These, these he views, and views them but to weep.

Yet are his tears no emblem of regret:
Cherish'd affection only bids them flow.
Pride, hope, and love forbid him to forget 
But warm his bosom with irnpassion'd glow.

Yet he prefers thee to the gilded domes 
Or gewgaw grottos of the vainly great,
Yet lingers 'mid thy damp and mossy tombs,
Nor breathes a murmur 'gainst the will of fate.

Haply thy sun, emerging, yet may shine, 
Thee to irradiate with meridian ray;
Hours splendid as the past may still be thine,
And bless thy future as thy former day.",Elegy
75,Theodora (Theo) Onken,"&gt;The flowers are now shattered
Their thorns bleed the rose
A Basket full of withered Daisies
Where the wild sunflower still grows; 

'Tis a backfall of listless last days
Oh, the grey simply swallows you
Gone are the blistering days of Summer
As Autumns amber breaks in anew; 

The shadows growing e'er longer
Gold and russet leaves fly away
Surounded by temporary graves for the Tulip
No where for the Meadow Lark to play; 

The morn ' air carries its crispness
While the dew, too soon, becomes frost
Woeful cries stir from all of Nature
In mourning, for Summer Days, now lost;

76,Amelia Opie,"Then thou hast learnt the secret of my soul,
Officious Friendship has its trust betrayed;
No more I need the bursting sigh control,
Nor summon pride my struggling soul to aid.

But think not banished hope returns again,
Think not I write thy thankless heart to move;
The faded form that tells my tender pain
May win thy pity, but it can't thy love.

Nor can I move thee by soft winning art,
By manners taught to charm, or practised glance;
Artless as thine, my too too feeling heart
Disdains the tutored eye, the fond advance.

The cold coquette, to win her destined prey,
May feign a passion which she ne'er can feel;
But I true Passion's soft commands obey,
And fain my tender feelings would conceal.

In others' eyes, when fixed on thine, I see
That fondness painted which alone I know;
Think not, my Henry, they can love like me,
More love I hide than they can e'er bestow. 

While tender glances their emotions speak,
And oft they heave and oft suppress the sigh;
O turn to me, behold my pallid cheek 
Shrinking from thine, behold my downcast eye!

While they by mirth, by wit, thine ear amuse,
And by their eloquence thy plaudits seek;
See me the fond contention still refuse,
Nor in thy presence, Henry, dare to speak.

When asked to breathe the soul-enchanting song,
See them o'erjoyed exert their utmost art;
While vainly I would join the choral throng,
Lost are those tones which once could touch the heart.

But, Henry, wert thou in Love's language wise,
Vainly would others more than Emma shine;
Beyond their sweetest strains thy heart would prize
One faint, one broken, tender tone of mine.

O proofs of passion, eloquent as vain!
By thee unheeded, or perhaps unknown,....
But learn, the pangs that prompt this pensive strain,
Ere long, disdainful youth, may be thine own.

Ah! no....in hopeless love thou canst not pine,
Thou ne'er canst woo the brightest maid in vain;
For thee Love's star midst cloudless skies will shine,
And light thy graceful steps to Hymen's fane:

While I, as hope, and strength, and life recede,
Far, far from thee shall waste the languid day;
Blest, if the scroll that speaks thy bliss I read,
But far more blest to feel life's powers decay.",Elegy
77,Mary Darby Robinson,"THE knell of death, that on the twilight gale, 
Swells its deep murmur to the pensive ear; 
In awful sounds repeats a mournful tale, 
And claims the tribute of a tender tear. 

The dreadful hour is past ! the mandate giv'n! 
The gentle MIDDLETON shall breathe no more, 
Yet who shall blame the wise decrees of Heaven, 
Or the dark mysteries of Fate explore? 

No more her converse shall delight the heart; 
No more her smile benign spread pleasure round; 
No more her liberal bosom shall impart 
The balm of pity to Affliction's wound. 

Her soul above the pride of noble birth, 
Above the praises of an empty name, 
By graceful MEEKNESS mark'd superior worth, 
By peerless VIRTUES claim'd the fairest fame, 

Nor did those Virtues flaunt their innate rays, 
To court applause, or charm the vulgar throng, 
No ostentatious glare illum'd her days, 
No idle boast escap'd her tuneful tongue. 

When FAME, ambitious to record her praise, 
On glitt'ring pinions spread her name afar, 
Her gentle nature shunn'd the dazzling blaze, 
Mild as the lustre of the morning star! 

DIVINE BENEVOLENCE around her shone! 
The chastest manners spoke her spotless mind; 
That Pow'r who gave now claims her for his own, 
Pure as the cherub she has left behind.

As round her couch the winged darts of death 
Reluctant flew from Fate's unerring bow, 
Immortal angels claim'd her quivering breath, 
And snatch'd her spirit from a world of woe. 

Calm resignation smil'd upon her cheek, 
And HOPE'S refulgent beam illum'd her eye; 
While FAITH, celestial VIRTUE'S handmaid meek, 
On wings of seraphs bore her to the sky. 

Ye poor, who from her gen'rous bounty fed; 
Oh! to HER mem'ry give the fame that's due; 
For oft, from pleasure's blithe meanders led, 
Her pensive bosom felt a pang for YOU.

To seek its resting place, beyond the skies; 
Where 'midst the glories of TH' ETERNAL's throne,

Stopt up with sighs, my fancie big with woes, 
Feels two twinn'd mountains struggle in her throws, 
Of boundless sorrow one, t'other of sin; 
For less let no one rate it to begin 
Where honour ends. In Great Gustavus flame 
That style burnt out, and wasted to a name, 
Does barely live with us. As when the stuff 
That fed it failes, the Taper turns to snuff. 
With this poor snuff, this ayerie shadow, we 
Of Fame and Honour must contented be; 
Since from the vain grasp of our wishes fled 
Their glorious substance is, now He is dead. 
Speak it again, and louder, louder yet; 
Else whil'st we hear the sound we shall forget 
What it delivers. Let hoarse rumor cry 
Till she so many ecchoes multiply, 
Those may like num'rous witnesses confute 
Our unbelieving soules, that would dispute 
And doubt this truth for ever. This one way 
Is left our incredulity to sway; 
To waken our deaf sense, and make our ears 
As open and dilated as our fears; 
That we may feel the blow, and feeling grieve, 
At what we would not feign, but must believe. 
And in that horrid faith behold the world 
From her proud height of expectation hurl'd, 
Stooping with him, as if she strove to have 
No lower Center now then Swedens grave. 
O could not all thy purchas'd victories 
Like to thy Fame thy Flesh immortalize? 
Were not thy vertue nor thy valour charmes 
To guard thy body from those outward harmes 
Which could not reach thy soul? could not thy spirit 
Lend somewhat which thy frailty might inherit 
From thy diviner part, that Death nor Hate 
Nor envy's bullets ere could penetrate? 
Could not thy early Trophies in stern fight 
Torn from the Dane, the Pole, the Moscovite? 
Which were thy triumphs seeds, as pledges sown, 
That when thy honours harvest was ripe grown, 
With full-summ'd wing thou Falcon-like wouldst fly 
And cuff the Eagle in the German sky: 
Forcing his iron beak and feathers feel 
They were not proof 'gainst thy victorious steel. 
Could not all these protect thee? or prevaile 
To fright that Coward Death, who oft grew pale 
To look thee and thy battails in the face? 
Alas they could not: Destiny gives place 
To none; nor is it seen that Princes lives 
Can saved be by their prerogatives. 
No more was thine; who clos'd in thy cold lead, 
Dost from thy self a mournful lecture read 
Of Mans short-dated glory: learn you Kings, 
You are like him but penetrable things; 
Though you from Demi-Gods derive your birth, 
You are at best but honourable earth: 
And howere sifted from that courser bran 
Which does compound and knead the common man, 
Nothing's immortal or from earth refin'd 
About you, but your Office and your Mind. 
Here then break your false Glasses, which present 
You greater then your Maker ever meant: 
Make truth your Mirrour now, since you find all 
That flatter you confuted by his fall. 
Yet since it was decreed thy lifes bright Sun 
Must be eclips'd ere thy full course was run, 
Be proud thou didst in thy black Obsequies 
With greater glory set then others rise. 
For in thy death, as life, thou heldest one 
Most just and regular proportion. 
Look how the Circles drawn by Compass meet 
Indivisibly joyned head to feet, 
And by continued points which them unite 
Grow at once Circular and Infinite: 
So did thy Fate and honour now contend 
To match thy brave beginning with thy end. 
Therefore thou hadst instead of Passing bells 
The Drums and Cannons thunder for thy knells; 
And in the Field thou did'st triumphing dy, 
Closing thy eye-lids with a victory: 
That so by thousands who there lost their breath 
King-like thou might'st be waited on in death. 
Liv'd Plutarch now, and would of Cæsar tell, 
He could make none but Thee his parallel; 
Whose tide of glory swelling to the brim 
Needs borrow no addition from Him. 
When did great Julius in any Clime 
Atchieve so much and in so small a time? 
Or if he did, yet shalt Thou in that land 
Single for him and unexampled stand. 
When ore the Germans first his Eagle towr'd 
What saw the Legions which on them he pour'd? 
But massie bodies, made their swords to try 
Subjects not for his fight, but slavery. 
In that so vast expanded peece of ground 
(Now Swedens Theater and Tom he found 
Nothing worth Cæsars valour, or his fear, 
No conqu'ring Army, nor a Tilley there, 
Whose strength nor wiles, nor practice in the warre 
Might the fierce Torrent of thy triumphs barre, 
But that thy winged sword twice made him yield, 
Both from his trenches beat, and from the field. 
Besides the Romane thought he had done much 
Did he the bank of Rhenus onely touch. 
But though his march was bounded by the Rhine 
Not Oder nor the Danube Thee confine; 
And but thy frailty did thy fame prevent, 
Thou hadst thy conquests strecht to such extent, 
Thou might'st Vienna reach, and after span 
From Mulda to the Baltick Ocean. 
But death hath spann'd thee: nor must we divine 
What heir thou leav'st to finish thy design, 
Or who shall thee succeed as Champion 
For liberty and for religion. 
Thy task is done; as in a Watch the spring 
Wound to the height, relaxes with the string: 
So thy steel nerves of conquest, from their steep 
Ascent declin'd, lie slackt in thy last sleep. 
Rest then triumphant soul! for ever rest! 
And, like the Phœnix in her spicy nest, 
Embalm'd with thine own merit, upward fly, 
Born in a cloud of perfume to the sky. 
Whil'st, as in deathless Urnes, each noble mind 
Treasures thy ashes which are left behind. 
And if perhaps no Cassiopeian spark 
(Which in the North did thy first rising mark) 
Shine ore thy Herse: the breath of our just praise 
Shall to the Firmament thy vertues raise; 
Then fix, and kindle them into a Starre, 
Whose influence may crown thy glorious warre.

79,Vignesh Ravishankar Shanmugam,"Deep down me, 
Recedes a voice, 
Gone with it's poise, 
An echo of a knight, 
A relentless warrior, 
Fought peacfully on his will's behalf, 
Thought gregariously to mend the world, 
Feigned by the beauty, 
Torn by the harsh reality, 
Lost his eccentricity.

Oh! there recedes the voice, 
Voice of the dumb, 
Left with it's flesh and bone, 
Borne to mourn, 
Tears alone to drown the soul, 
Receded the voice, 
Dumped me heartless, painless, 
To face the crooked world.",Elegy
80,William Cowper,"As yet a stranger to the gentle fires
That Amathusia's smiling Queen inspires,
Not seldom I derided Cupid's darts,
And scorn'd his claim to rule all human hearts.
Go, child, I said, transfix the tim'rous dove,
An easy conquest suits an infant Love;
Enslave the sparrow, for such prize shall be
Sufficient triumph to a Chief like thee;
Why aim thy idle arms at human kind?
Thy shafts prevail not 'gainst the noble mind.
The Cyprian heard, and, kindling into ire,
(None kindles sooner) burn'd with double fire.
It was the Spring, and newly risen day
Peep'd o'er the hamlets on the First of May;
My eyes too tender for the blaze of light,
Still sought the shelter of retiring night,
When Love approach'd, in painted plumes arrayed;
Th'insidious god his rattling darts betray'd,
Nor less his infant features, and the sly
Sweet intimations of his threat'ning eye.
Such the Sigeian boy is seen above,
Filling the goblet for imperial Jove;
Such he, on whom the nymphs bestow'd their charms,
Hylas, who perish'd in a Naiad's arms.
Angry he seem'd, yet graceful in his ire,
And added threats, not destitute of fire.
'My power,' he said, 'by others pain alone,
'Twere best to learn; now learn it by thy own!
With those, who feel my power, that pow'r attest!
And in thy anguish be my sway confest! 
I vanquish'd Phoebus, though returning vain
From his new triumph o'er the Python slain,
And, when he thinks on Daphne, even He
Will yield the prize of archery to me.
A dart less true the Parthian horseman sped,
Behind him kill'd, and conquer'd as he fled,
Less true th'expert Cydonian, and less true
The youth, whose shaft his latent Procris slew.
Vanquish'd by me see huge Orion bend,
By me Alcides, and Alcides's friend.
At me should Jove himself a bolt design,
His bosom first should bleed transfix'd by mine.
But all thy doubts this shaft will best explain,
Nor shall it teach thee with a trivial pain,
Thy Muse, vain youth! shall not thy peace ensure,
Nor Phoebus' serpent yield thy wound a cure.
He spoke, and, waving a bright shaft in air,
Sought the warm bosom of the Cyprian fair.
That thus a child should bluster in my ear
Provok'd my laughter more than mov'd my fear.
I shun'd not, therefore, public haunts, but stray'd
Careless in city, or suburban shade,
And passing and repassing nymphs that mov'd
With grace divine, beheld where'er I rov'd.
Bright shone the vernal day, with double blaze,
As beauty gave new force to Phoebus' rays.
By no grave scruples check'd I freely eyed
The dang'rous show, rash youth my only guide,
And many a look of many a Fair unknown
Met full, unable to control my own. 
But one I mark'd (then peace forsook my breast)
One--Oh how far superior to the rest!
What lovely features! Such the Cyprian Queen
Herself might wish, and Juno wish her mien.
The very nymph was she, whom when I dar'd
His arrows, Love had even then prepar'd.
Nor was himself remote, nor unsupplied
With torch well-trimm'd and quiver at his side;
Now to her lips he clung, her eye-lids now,
Then settled on her cheeks or on her brow.
And with a thousand wounds from ev'ry part
Pierced and transpierced my undefended heart.
A fever, new to me, of fierce desire
Now seiz'd my soul, and I was all on fire,
But she, the while, whom only I adore,
Was gone, and vanish'd to appear no more.
In silent sadness I pursue my way,
I pause, I turn, proceed, yet wish to stay,
And while I follow her in thought, bemoan
With tears my soul's delight so quickly flown.
When Jove had hurl'd him to the Lemnian coast
So Vulcan sorrow'd for Olympus lost,
And so Oeclides, sinking into night,
From the deep gulph look'd up to distant light.
Wretch that I am, what hopes for me remain
Who cannot cease to love, yet love in vain?
Oh could I once, once more, behold the Fair,
Speak to her, tell her of the pangs I bear,
Perhaps she is not adamant, would show
Perhaps some pity at my tale of woe. 
Oh inauspicious flame--'tis mine to prove
A matchless instance of disastrous love.
Ah spare me, gentle Pow'r!--If such thou be
Let not thy deeds, and nature disagree.
Now I revere thy fires, thy bow, thy darts:
Now own thee sov'reign of all human hearts.
Spare me, and I will worship at no shrine
With vow and sacrifice, save only thine.
Remove! no--grant me still this raging woe!
Sweet is the wretchedness, that lovers know:
But pierce hereafter (should I chance to see
One destined mine) at once both her and me.

Such were the trophies, that in earlier days,
By vanity seduced I toil'd to raise,
Studious yet indolent, and urg'd by youth,
That worst of teachers, from the ways of Truth;
Till learning taught me, in his shady bow'r,
To quit love's servile yoke, and spurn his pow'r.
Then, on a sudden, the fierce flame supprest,
A frost continual settled on my breast, 
Whence Cupid fears his flames extinct to see,
And Venus dreads a Diomede15 in me.",Elegy
81,Mary Darby Robinson,"DEAR SHADE OF HIM, who grac'd the mimick scene,
And charm'd attention with resistless pow'r;
Whose wond'rous art, whose fascinating mien,
Gave glowing rapture to the short-liv'd hour! 

Accept the mournful verse, the ling'ring sigh,
The tear that faithful Mem'ry stays to shed;
The SACRED TEAR, that from Reflection's eye,
Drops on the ashes of the sainted dead. 

Lov'd by the grave, and courted by the young,
In social comforts eminently blest;
All hearts rever'd the precepts of thy tongue,
And Envy's self thy eloquence confess'd. 

Who could like thee the soul's wild tumults paint,
Or wake the torpid ear with lenient art?
Touch the nice sense with pity's dulcet plaint,
Or soothe the sorrows of the breaking heart? 

Who can forget thy penetrating eye, 
The sweet bewitching smile, th' empassion'd look?
The clear deep whisper, the persuasive sigh,
The feeling tear that Nature's language spoke? 

Rich in each treasure bounteous Heaven could lend,
For private worth distinguish'd and approv'd,
The pride of WISDOM,­VIRTUE's darling friend,
By MANSFIELD honor'd­and by CAMDEN lov'd! 

The courtier's cringe, the flatt'rer's abject smile,
The subtle arts of well-dissembled praise,
Thy soul abhorr'd;­above the gloss of guile,
Truth lead thy steps, and Friendship crown'd thy days. 

Oft in thy HAMPTON's dark embow'ring shade
The POET's hand shall sweep the trembling string;
While the proud tribute §to thy mem'ry paid,
The voice of GENIUS on the gale shall fling. 

Yes, SHERIDAN! thy soft melodious verse
Still vibrates on a nation's polish'd ear;
Fondly it hover'd o'er the sable hearse,
Hush'd the loud plaint, and triumph'd in a tear. 

In life united by congenial minds,
Dear to the MUSE, to sacred friendship true;
Around her darling's urn a wreath SHE binds,
A deathless wreath­immortaliz'd by YOU! 

But say, dear shade, is kindred mem'ry flown?
Has widow'd love at length forgot to weep?
That no kind verse, or monumental stone,
Marks the lone spot where thy cold relics sleep! 

Dear to a nation, grateful to thy muse,
That nation's tears upon thy grave shall flow,
For who the gentle tribute can refuse,
Which thy fine feeling gave to fancied woe? 

Thou who, by many an anxious toilsome hour,
Reap'd the bright harvest of luxuriant Fame,
Who snatch'd from dark oblivion's barb'rous pow'r
The radiant glories of a SHAKSPERE's name! 

Rembrance oft shall paint the mournful scene
Where the slow fun'ral spread its length'ning gloom,
Where the deep murmur, and dejected mien,
In artless sorrow linger'd round thy tomb. 

And tho' no laurel'd bust, or labour'd line,
Shall bid the passing stranger stay to weep;
Thy SHAKSPERE's hand shall point the hallow'd shrine,
And Britain's genius with thy ashes sleep.

Then rest in peace, O ever sacred shade!
Your kindred souls exulting FAME shall join;
And the same wreath thy hand for SHAKSPERE made,
Gemm'd with her tears about THY GRAVE SHALL TWINE.",Elegy
82,Thomas Parnell,"In vain, poor Nymph, to please our youthful sight 
You sleep in cream and frontlets all the night, 
Your face with patches soil, with paint repair, 
Dress with gay gowns, and shade with foreign hair. 
If truth in spight of manners must be told, 
Why, really fifty-five is something old. 

Once you were young; or one, whose life's so long 
She might have born my mother, tells me wrong. 
And once (since Envy's dead before you die,) 
The women own, you play'd a sparkling eye, 
Taught the light foot a modish little trip, 
And pouted with the prettiest purple lip -- 

To some new charmer are the roses fled, 
Which blew, to damask all thy cheek with red; 
Youth calls the Graces there to fix their reign, 
And airs by thousands fill their easy train. 
So parting Summer bids her flow'ry prime 
Attend the sun to dress some foreign clime, 
While with'ring seasons in succession, here, 
Strip the gay gardens, and deform the year. 

But thou (since Nature bids) the world resign, 
'Tis now thy daughter's daughter's time to shine. 
With more address, (or such as pleases more) 
She runs her female exercises o'er, 
Unfurls or closes, raps or turns the Fan, 
And smiles, or blushes at the creature Man. 
With quicker life, as guilded coaches pass, 
In sideling courtesy she drops the glass. 

With better strength, on visit-days she bears 
To mount her fifty flights of ample stairs. 
Her mein, her shape, her temper, eyes and tongue 
Are sure to conquer. -- for the rogue is young; 
And all that's madly wild, or oddly gay, 
We call it only pretty Fanny's way. 

Let time that makes you homely, make you sage, 
The sphere of wisdom is the sphere of age. 
'Tis true, when beauty dawns with early fire, 
And hears the flatt'ring tongues of soft desire, 
If not from virtue, from its gravest ways 
The soul with pleasing avocation strays. 
But beauty gone, 'tis easier to be wise; 
As harper better, by the loss of eyes. 

Henceforth retire, reduce your roving airs, 
Haunt less the plays, and more the publick pray'rs, 
Reject the Mechlin Head, and gold brocade, 
Go pray, in sober Norwich Crape array'd. 
Thy pendent diamonds let thy Fanny take, 
(Their trembling lustre shows how much you shake;) 
Or bid her wear thy necklace row'd with pearl, 
You'll find your Fanny an obedient girl. 

So for the rest, with less incumbrance hung, 
You walk thro' life, unmingled with the young; 
And view the shade and substance as you pass 
With joint endeavour trifling at the glass, 
Or Folly drest, and rambling all her days, 
To meet her counterpart, and grow by praise: 
Yet still sedate your self, and gravely plain, 
You neither fret, nor envy at the vain. 

'Twas thus (if Man with Woman we compare) 
The wise Athenian crost a glittering fair, 
Unmov'd by tongues and sights, he walk'd the place, 
Thro' tape, toys, tinsel, gimp, perfume, and lace; 
Then bends from Mars's Hill his awful eyes, 
And ""What a world I never want?"" he cries; 
But cries unheard: For Folly will be free. 
So parts the buzzing gaudy crowd, and he: 
As careless he for them, as they for him; 
He wrapt in wisdom, and they whirl'd by whim.",Elegy
83,Henry King,"I will not weep, for 'twere as great a sin 
To shed a tear for thee, as to have bin 
An Actor in thy death. Thy life and age 
Was but a various Scene on fortunes Stage, 
With whom thou tugg'st &amp; strov'st ev'n out of breath 
In thy long toil: nere master'd till thy death; 
And then despight of trains and cruell wit, 
Thou did'st at once subdue malice and it. 
I dare not then so blast thy memory 
As say I do lament or pity thee. 
Were I to choose a subject to bestow 
My pity on, he should be one as low 
In spirit as desert. That durst not dy 
But rather were content by slavery 
To purchase life: or I would pity those 
Thy most industrious and friendly foes: 
Who when they thought to make thee scandals story 
Lent thee a swifter flight to Heav'n and glory. 
That thought by cutting off some wither'd dayes, 
(Which thou could'st spare them) to eclipse thy praise; 
Yet gave it brighter foil, made thy ag'd fame 
Appear more white and fair, then foul their shame: 
And did promote an Execution 
Which (but for them) Nature and Age had done. 
Such worthless things as these were onely born 
To live on Pities almes (too mean for scorn.) 
Thou dy'dst an envious wonder, whose high fate 
The world must still admire, scarce imitate.",Elegy
84,James Hogg,"Fair was thy blossom, tender flower,
That open'd like the rose in May,
Though nursed beneath the chilly shower
Of fell regret, for love's decay.

How oft thy mother heaved the sigh
O'er wreaths of honour early shorn,
Before thy sweet and guiltless eye
Had open'd on the dawn of morn!

How oft, above thy lowly bed,
When all in silence slumber'd low,
The fond and filial tear was shed,
Thou child of love, of shame, and woe!

Her wrong'd but gentle bosom burn'd
With joy thy opening bloom to see;
The only breast that o'er thee yearn'd;
The only heart that cared for thee.

Oft her young eye, with tear-drops bright,
Pleaded with Heaven for her sweet child,
When faded dreams of past delight
O'er recollection wander'd wild.

Fair was thy blossom, bonnie flower,
Fair as the softest wreaths of spring,
When late I saw thee seek the bower
In peace thy morning hymn to sing.

Thy little foot across the lawn
Scarce from the primrose press'd the dew;
I thought the spirit of the dawn
Before me to the greenwood flew.

E'en then the shaft was on the wing,
Thy spotless soul from earth to sever,
A tear of pity wet the string
That twang'd, and seal'd thy doom for ever.

I saw thee late, the emblem fair
Of beauty, innocence, and truth,
Start tiptoe on the verge of air, 
'Twixt childhood and unstable youth;

But now I see thee stretch'd at rest:
To break that rest shall wake no morrow - 
Pale as the grave-flower on thy breast!
Poor child of love, of shame, and sorrow!

May thy long sleep be sound and sweet;
Thy visions fraught with bliss to be;
And long the daisy, emblem meet,
Shall shed its earliest tear o'er thee!",Elegy
85,William Cowper,"At length, my friend, the far-sent letters come,
Charged with thy kindness, to their destin'd home,
They come, at length, from Deva's Western side,
Where prone she seeks the salt Vergivian tide.
Trust me, my joy is great that thou shouldst be,
Though born of foreign race, yet born for me,
And that my sprightly friend, now free to roam,
Must seek again so soon his wonted home.
I well content, where Thames with refluent tide
My native city laves, meantime reside,
Nor zeal nor duty, now, my steps impell
To reedy Cam, and my forbidden cell.
Nor aught of pleasure in those fields have I,
That, to the musing bard, all shade deny.
'Tis time, that I, a pedant's threats disdain,
And fly from wrongs, my soul will ne'er sustain.
If peaceful days, in letter'd leisure spent
Beneath my father's roof, be banishment,
Then call me banish'd, I will ne'er refuse
A name expressive of the lot I chuse. 
I would that exiled to the Pontic shore,
Rome's hapless bard had suffer'd nothing more!
He then had equall'd even Homer's lays,
And, Virgil! thou hadst won but second praise.
For here I woo the Muse with no control,
And here my books--my life--absorb me whole.
Here too I visit, or to smile, or weep,
The winding theatre's majestic sweep;
The grave or gay colloquial scene recruits
My spirits spent in Learning's long pursuits. 
Whether some Senior shrewd, or spendthrift heir,
Wooer, or soldier, now unarm'd, be there,
Or some coif'd brooder o'er a ten years' cause
Thunder the Norman gibb'rish of the laws.
The lacquey, there, oft dupes the wary sire,
And, artful, speeds th'enamour'd son's desire.
There, virgins oft, unconscious what they prove,
What love is, know not, yet, unknowing, love.
Or, if impassion'd Tragedy wield high
The bloody sceptre, give her locks to fly 
Wild as the winds, and roll her haggard eye,
I gaze, and grieve, still cherishing my grief.
At times, e'en bitter tears! yield sweet relief.
As when from bliss untasted torn away,
Some youth dies, hapless, on his bridal day,
Or when the ghost, sent back from shades below,
Fills the assassin's heart with vengeful woe,
When Troy, or Argos, the dire scene affords,
Or Creon's hall laments its guilty lords.
Nor always city-pent or pent at home 
I dwell, but when Spring calls me forth to roam
Expatiate in our proud suburban shades
Of branching elm that never sun pervades.
Here many a virgin troop I may descry,
Like stars of mildest influence, gliding by,
Oh forms divine! Oh looks that might inspire
E'en Jove himself, grown old, with young desire!
Oft have I gazed on gem-surpassing eyes,
Outsparkling every star that gilds the skies.
Necks whiter than the iv'ry arm bestow'd 
By Jove on Pelops, or the Milky Road!
Bright locks, Love's golden snares, these falling low,
Those playing wanton o'er the graceful brow!
Cheeks too, more winning sweet than after show'r,
Adonis turn'd to Flora's fav'rite flow'r!
Yield, Heroines, yield, and ye who shar'd th'embrace
Of Jupiter in ancient times, give place;
Give place ye turban'd Fair of Persia's coast,
And ye, not less renown'd, Assyria's boast!
Submit, ye nymphs of Greece! Ye once the bloom 
Of Ilion, and all ye of haughty Rome,
Who swept of old her theatres with trains
Redundant, and still live in classic strains!
To British damsels beauty's palm is due,
Aliens! to follow them is fame for you.
Oh city, founded by Dardanian hands,
Whose towering front the circling realm commands,
Too blest abode! no loveliness we see
In all the earth, but it abounds in thee.
The virgin multitude that daily meets,
Radiant with gold and beauty, in thy streets,
Outnumbers all her train of starry fires
With which Diana gilds thy lofty spires.
Fame says, that wafted hither by her doves,
With all her host of quiver-bearing Loves,
Venus, prefering Paphian scenes no more,
Has fix'd her empire on thy nobler shore.
But lest the sightless boy inforce my stay,
I leave these happy walls, while yet I may.
Immortal Moly shall secure my heart
From all the sorc'ry of Circaean art,
And I will e'en repass Cam's reedy pools
To face once more the warfare of the Schools.
Meantime accept this trifle; Rhymes, though few,
Yet such as prove thy friend's remembrance true.",Elegy
86,Aleister Crowley,"Here rests beneath this hospitable spot
A youth to flats and flatties not unknown.
The Plymouth Brethren gave it to him hot;
Trinity, Cambridge, claimed him for her own.

At chess a minor master, Hoylake set
His handicap a 2. Love drove him crazy;
Thrre thousand women used to call him “pet”;
In other gardens daffodil or daisy?

He climbed a lot of mountains in his time.
He stalked the tiger, bear and elephant.
he wrote a stack of poems, some sublime
Some not. Plays, essays, pictures, tales -my aunt!

He had the gift of laughing at himself.
Most affably he talked and walked with God.
And now the silly bastard’s on the shelf,
We’ve buried him beneath another sod.",Elegy
87,James Beattie,"Tir'd with the busy crouds, that all the day 
Impatient throng where Folly's altars flame, 
My languid powers dissolve with quick decay, 
Till genial Sleep repair the sinking frame. 

Hail kind Reviver! that canst lull the cares, 
And every weary sense compose to rest, 
Lighten th' oppressive load which Anguish bears, 
And warm with hope the cold desponding breast. 

Touch'd by thy rod, from Power's majestic brow 
Drops the gay plume; he pines a lowly clown; 
And on the cold earth stretch'd the son of Woe 
Quaffs Pleasure's draught, and wears a fancy'd crown. 

When rous'd by thee, on boundless pinions born 
Fancy to fairy scenes exults to rove, 
Now scales the cliff gay-gleaming on the morn, 
Now sad and silent treads the deepening grove; 

Or skims the main, and listens to the storms, 
Marks the long waves roll far remote away; 
Or mingling with ten thousand glittering forms 
Floats on the gale, and basks in purest day. 

Haply, ere long, pierc'd by the howling blast 
Through dark and pathless desarts I shall roam, 
Plunge down th' unfathom'd deep, or shrink aghast 
Where bursts the shrieking spectre from the tomb: 

Perhaps loose Luxury's enchanting smile 
Shall lure my steps to some romantic dale, 
Where Mirth's light freaks th' unheeded hours beguile, 
And airs of rapture warble in the gale. 

Instructive emblem of this mortal state! 
Where scenes as various every hour arise 
In swift succession, which the hand of Fate 
Presents, then snatches from our wondering eyes. 

Be taught, vain man, how fleeting all thy joys, 
Thy boasted grandeur, and thy glittering store; 
Death comes, and all thy fancy'd bliss destroys, 
Quick as a dream it fades, and is no more. 

And, sons of Sorrow! though the threatening storm 
Of angry Fortune overhang a while, 
Let not her frowns your inward peace deform; 
Soon happier days in happier climes shall smile. 

Through earth's throng'd visions while we toss forlorn, 
'Tis tumult all, and rage, and restless strife; 
But these shall vanish like the dreams of morn, 
When Death awakes us to immortal life.",Elegy
88,Leo Yankevich,"After the tears, heartfelt tears and crocodile tears,   
I sit here with mouldy bread crumbs, dill leaves and salt.    

The plastic clock above the fridge strikes the hour  
to the sound of the same old quarrelling in the street,     

echoes resound in the gutters like bits of truth  
and madness still propels our globe like the first ache.    

We’ve buried you the way you asked: with no stone  
or wooden cross above your decaying forehead,     

only the simple sky, the clouds, and the old sun.  
And at night the moon and the stars will comfort you    

more faithfully than any human ever could.  
Sad grand poet, I wish I could find the right words,     

but for the thousandth time the cold wind says it best,   
and nothing is more eloquent than its goodbye.",Elegy
89,Thomas Chatterton,"No more I hail the morning's golden gleam,
No more the wonders of the view I sing;
Friendship requires a melancholy theme,
At her command the awful lyre I string!

Now as I wander through this leafless grove,
Where tempests howl, and blasts eternal rise,
How shall I teach the chorded shell to move,
Or stay the gushing torrent from my eyes?

Phillips! great master of the boundless lyre,
The would my soul-rack'd muse attempt to paint;
Give me a double portion of thy fire,
Or all the powers of language are too faint.

Say, soul unsullied by the filth of vice,
Say, meek-eyed spirit, where's thy tuneful shell,
Which when the silver stream was lock'd with ice,
Was wont to cheer the tempest-ravaged dell?

Oft as the filmy veil of evening drew
The thick'ning shade upon the vivid green,
Thou, lost in transport at the dying view,
Bid'st the ascending muse display the scene.

When golden Autumn, wreathed in ripen'd corn,
From purple clusters prest the foamy wine,
Thy genius did his sallow brows adorn,
And made the beauties of the season thine.

With rustling sound the yellow foliage flies,
And wantons with the wind in rapid whirls;
The gurgling riv'let to the valley hies,
Whilst on its bank the spangled serpent curls.

The joyous charms of Spring delighted saw
Their beauties doubly glaring in thy lay;
Nothing was Spring which Phillips did not draw,
And every image of his muse was May.

So rose the regal hyacinthial star,
So shone the verdure of the daisied bed,
So seemed the forest glimmering from afar;
You saw the real prospect as you read.

Majestic Summer's blooming flow'ry pride
Next claim'd the honour of his nervous song;
He taught the stream in hollow trills to glide,
And led the glories of the year along.

Pale rugged Winter bending o'er his tread,
His grizzled hair bedropt with icy dew;
His eyes, a dusky light congealed and dead,
His robe, a tinge of bright ethereal blue.

His train a motley'd, sanguine, sable cloud,
He limps along the russet, dreary moor,
Whilst rising whirlwinds, blasting, keen, and loud,
Roll the white surges to the sounding shore.

Nor were his pleasures unimproved by thee;
Pleasures he has, though horridly deform'd;
The polished lake, the silver'd hill we see,
Is by thy genius fired, preserved, and warm'd.

The rough October has his pleasures too;
But I'm insensible to every joy:
Farewell the laurel! now I grasp the yew,
And all my little powers in grief employ.

Immortal shadow of my much-loved friend!
Clothed in thy native virtue meet my soul,
When on the fatal bed, my passions bend,
And curb my floods of anguish as they roll.

In thee each virtue found a pleasing cell,
Thy mind was honour, thy soul divine;
With thee did every god of genius dwell,
Thou was the Helicon of all the nine.

Fancy, whose various figure-tinctured vest
Was ever changing to a different hue;
Her head, with varied bays and flow'rets drest,
Her eyes, two spangles of the morning dew.

With dancing attitude she swept thy string;
And now she soars, and now again descends;
And now reclining on the zephyr's wing,
Unto the velvet-vested mead she bends.

Peace, deck'd in all the softness of the dove,
Over thy passions spread her silver plume;
The rosy veil of harmony and love
Hung on thy soul in eternal bloom.

Peace, gentlest, softest of the virtues, spread
Her silver pinions, wet with dewy tears,
Upon her best distinguished poet's head,
And taught his lyre the music of the spheres.

Temp'rance, with health and beauty in her train,
And massy-muscled strength in graceful pride,
Pointed at scarlet luxury and pain,
And did at every frugal feast preside.

Black melancholy stealing to the shade
With raging madness, frantic, loud, and dire,
Whose bloody hand displays the reeking blade,
Were strangers to thy heaven-directed lyre.

Content, who smiles in every frown of fate,
Wreath'd thy pacific brow and sooth'd thy ill:
In thy own virtues and thy genius great,
The happy muse laid every trouble still.

But see! the sick'ning lamp of day retires,
And the meek evening shakes the dusky grey;
The west faint glimmers with the saffron fires,
And like thy life, O Phillips! dies away.

Here, stretched upon this heaven-ascending hill,
I'll wait the horrors of the coming night,
I'll imitate the gently-plaintive rill,
And by the glare of lambent vapours write.

Wet with the dew the yellow hawthorns bow;
The rustic whistles through the echoing cave;
Far o'er the lea the breathing cattle low,
And the full Avon lifts the darken'd wave.

Now, as the mantle of the evening swells
Upon my mind, I feel a thick'ning gloom!
Ah! could I charm by necromantic spells
The soul of Phillips from the deathy tomb!

Then would we wander through the darken'd vale,
In converse such as heavenly spirits use,
And, borne upon the pinions of the gale,
Hymn the Creator, and exert the muse.

But, horror to reflection! now no more
Will Phillips sing, the wonder of the plain!
When, doubting whether they might not adore,
Admiring mortals heard his nervous strain.

See! see! the pitchy vapour hides the lawn,
Nought but a doleful bell of death is heard,
Save where into a blasted oak withdrawn
The scream proclaims the curst nocturnal bird.

Now, rest my muse, but only rest to weep
A friend made dear by every sacred tie;
Unknown to me be comfort peace or sleep:
Phillips is dead- 'tis pleasure then to die.

Few are the pleasures Chatterton e'er knew,
Short were the moments of his transient peace;
But melancholy robb'd him of those few,
And this hath bid all future comfort cease.

And can the muse be silent, Phillips gone!
And am I still alive? My soul, arise!
The robe of immortality put on,
And meet thy Phillips in his native skies.",Elegy

Afford our losse? thy dull unactive streames 
Can no new beauty raise, nor yet restore

If none of these, but that whil'st thou did'st sleep 
Upon thy sandy pillow in the deep, 
This mischief stole upon us: may our grief 
Waken thy just revenge on that slie thief,

Henceforth invert thy order, and provide

91,William Shenstone,"O grief of griefs! that Envy's frantic ire
Should rob the living virtue of its praise;
O foolish Muses! that with zeal aspire
To deck the cold insensate shrine with bays.

To tread the skies with radiant garlands crown'd;
Say, will she hear the distant voice of Fame?
Or, hearing, fancy sweetness in the sound?

Perhaps even Genius pours a slighted lay;
Perhaps even Friendship sheds a fruitless tear;
Even Lyttleton but vainly trims the bay,
And fondly graces Hammond's mournful bier.

Though weeping virgins haunt his favour'd urn,
Renew their chaplets, and repeat their sighs;
Though near his tomb SabÃ¦an odours burn,
The loit'ring fragrance will it reach the skies?

No; should his Delia votive wreaths prepare,
Delia might place the votive wreaths in vain:
Yet the dear hope of Delia's future care
Once crown'd his pleasures, and dispell'd his pain.

Can every sense of present joys excel;
For this, great Hadrian chose laborious days;
Through this, expiring, bade a gay farewell.

To life's precarious date confine their care?
O teach them you to spread the sacred base,
To plan a work through latest ages fair!

Is it small transport, as with curious eye
You trace the story of each Attic sage,
To think your blooming praise shall time defy?
Shall waft, like odours, through the pleasing page?

To mark the day when, through the bulky tome,
Around your name the varying style refines?
And readers call their lost attention home,
Led by that index where true genius shines?

Whose ardent bosoms catch this ancient fire;
Cold interest melts before the vivid flame,
And patriot ardours but with life expire.",Elegy
92,chandra thiagarajan,"Taj Mahal, the glory, of India
Is an epic marble monument
Situated in Uttar Pradesh, Agra
Which  is immensely magnificent.

It majestically, with dignity,  stands
On the banks of river Yamuna- 
Where many a tourist happily lands
To  view the spectacle and the panorama.

Shah Jahan the Mughal Emperor built
In memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal
The Paradise on Earth that would never wilt
A   monument of enormous beauty-  the Taj Mahal.! 

In the year 1631, the Queen passed away
And the Emperor was inconsolable- 
In his misery, none could him allay.
His mission now, was to erect a monument admirable.

His deep love for her being intangible
He wished to build a sepulchre in her memory
 The monument, he thought, ought to be incredible
With  a never before thought of finery.

For money the Emperor had no dearth
He spent more than thirty two crores
In those days it was many times its worth
With all his amassed resources.

Over 42 acres of land, the monument occupied
The central focus of the complex being the tomb
Four tall minarets frame on every side
A spectacular marble dome surrounds the tomb.

Islamic, Indian, Ottoman, Turkish, and Persian
Are the architectural style- - elements
The principal designer Lahauri’s combinations
Is an integrated complex of structures’ placements.

Twenty two long years it took
Employing workers twenty thousand
To fetch the phenomenal beauteous look
 With  over thousand elephants summoned.

To transport the required material
From the whole of India
For the construction ideal
With  sculptors from Persia.

The translucent white marble
Was brought from Makrana and Rajasthan
From China came Jade and Crystal
The Lapis Lazuli was from Afghanisthan.

The turquoise was from Tibet
Sapphire was got from Sri Lanka
For the special carving of the rosette
Carnelian was got from Arabia.

Calligraphers came from Syria
From Bukhara too came sculptors
The In-layers came from South India
And from Baluchisthan came stone-cutters.

Taj Mahal is a marble mausoleum in white
Jeweled in stones semi-precious
It is an unimaginable delight
To  eye the paradise on earth for the empress.

The main monument is two storeyed
With a huge rotunda over the octagonal building 
The celebrated duo are there buried
Where sky-scrapper minarets are shielding. 

The top with a lotus design is decorated
Which  serves to accentuate the height
The finial by a crescent moon is spotted
A  typical Islamic motif –which is a lovely sight.

 To the complex of Taj Mahal portal
Are three beautiful  gate-ways –lofty
Richly decorated is the portion- central
With delicate carvings in marble—a beauty.

Dazzling precious stones, inlaid, adorn
In floral and geometric illustrations
Inscription with passages from Quran
Display the Islamic faith—compositions.

Taj Mahal means Crown Palace
The  visual grandeur with no equal
Gave the Emperor much solace
For  the rich beauty had no rival.

The Taj is beauty personified
Bringing a saga come alive
It stands with its blissful pride
As one and only of its kind that does survive.

It is considered as an architectural wonder
Which  is beyond the scope of words
In the full moon light the splendor
Of the combination of solids and voids

Concave and convex and light shadow
Of the arches and domes are all aesthetic.
In the early morn it is aglow
And the visual treat is ecstatic.

The Taj,  different shades displays
It is pinkish in the morning
With the moon it shines with golden rays
 And is milky white in the evening.

Taj Mahal is greatly remarkable
For its perfect geometric proportions
And for the marvel of marvels in marble
As  also for its architectural decorations.

 The Taj Mahal has been classified- - right
As a new  “ Wonder of the World” for its charm
It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site
To  take good care lest it comes to harm.

 It is the ethereal love for his wife Mumtaz Mahal
That  induced the King to build the Taj for her glory
Rabindranath Tagore described the Taj Mahal
As- “It’s a tear drop on the cheek of history”.

Taj Mahal was the ultimate realization
As a symbol of pure love and emotion
Of Emperor Shah Jahan’s dream of immortalization
Of  the divinity of his eternal love and passion.",Elegy

The word of nourishment passes through the women,
soldiers and orchards rooted in constellations,
white towers, eyes of children: 
saying in time of war What shall we feed?
I cannot say the end.

Nourish beginnings, let us nourish beginnings.
Not all things are blest, but the
seeds of all things are blest.
The blessing is in the seed.

This moment, this seed, this wave of the sea, this look, this instant of love.
Years over wars and an imagining of peace.  Or the expiation journey

To a Friend


For rural virtues, and for native skies,
I bade Augusta's venal sons farewell;
Now 'mid the trees I see my smoke arise,
Now hear the fountains bubbling round my cell.

O may that Genius, which secures my rest,
Preserve this villa for a friend that's dear!
Ne'er may my vintage glad the sordid breast,
Ne'er tinge the lip that dares be insincere!

Far from these paths, ye faithless Friends, depart!
Fly my plain board, abhor my hostile name!
Hence the faint verse that flows not from the heart,
But mourns, in labour'd strains, the price of fame!

O loved Simplicity! be thine the prize!
Assiduous Art correct her page in vain!
His be the palm, who, guiltless of disguise,
Contemns the power the dull resource to feign!

Still may the mourner, lavish of his tears
For lucre's venal need, invite my scorn!
Still may the bard, dissembling doubts and fears,
For praise, for flattery sighing, sigh forlorn!

Soft as the line of lovesick Hammond flows,
'Twas his fond heart effused the melting theme;
Ah! never could Aonia's hill disclose
So fair a fountain, or so loved a stream.

Ye loveless Bards! intent with artful pains
To form a sigh, or to contrive a tear!
Forego your Pindus, and on - plains
Survey Camilla's charms, and grow sincere.

But thou, my Friend! while in thy youthful soul
Love's gentle tyrant seats his awful throne,
Write from thy bosom-let not art control
The ready pen, that makes his edicts known.

Pleasing, when youth is long expired, to trace
The forms our pencil or our pen design'd!
'Such was our youthful air, and shape, and face!
Such the soft image of our youthful mind!'

Soft, whilst we sleep beneath the rural bowers,
The Loves and Graces steal unseen away;
And where the turf diffused its pomp of flowers,
We wake to wintry scenes of chill decay!

Curse the sad fortune that detains thy fair;
Praise the soft hours that gave thee to her arms;
Paint thy proud scorn of every vulgar care,
When hope exalts thee, or when doubt alarms.

Where with Oenone thou hast worn the day,
Near fount or stream, in meditation, rove;
If in the grove Oenone loved to stray,
The faithful Muse shall meet thee in the grove.",Elegy

In any Circumstance approach'd by You, 
From whose each motion we might plain descry 
The black Ostents of this late Tragedy. 
For when the King through Storms in Scotland bred 
To his Great Councel for his shelter fled, 
When in that meeting every Error gain'd 
Redresses sooner granted, than Complain'd: 
Not all those frank Concessions or Amends 
Did suit the then too Powerfull Faction's ends, 
No Acts of Grace at present would Content, 
Nor Promise of Triennial Parl'ament, 
Till by a formal Law the King had past 
This Session should at Your pleasure last. 
So having got the Bitt, and that 'twas known 
No power could dissolve You but Your own, 
Your gracelesse Junto make such use of this, 
As once was practis'd by Semiramis; 
Who striving by a subtile Sute to prove 
The largenesse of her Husbands Trust and Love, 
Did from the much abused King obtain 
That for three dayes She might sole Empresse reign: 
Before which time expir'd, the bloody Wife 
Depriv'd her Lord both of his Crown and Life. 
There needs no Comment when your deeds apply 
The Demonstration of her Treachery. 
Which to effect by Absolon's foul wile 
You of the Peoples Heart your Prince beguile; 
Urging what Eases they might reap by it 
Did you their Legislative Judges sit. 
How did you fawn upon, and Court the Rout, 
Whose Clamour carry'd your whole Plot about? 
How did you thank Seditious men that came 
To bring Petitions which your selves did frame? 
And lest they wanted Hands to set them on, 
You lead the way by throwing the first stone. 
For in that Libel after Midnight born, 
Wherewith your Faction labour'd till the Morn, 
That famous Lye, you a Remonstrance name;
Were not Reproaches your malitious aim? 
Was not the King's dishonour your intent 
By Slanders to traduce his Government? 
All which your spightful Cunning did contrive 
Men must receive through your false Perspective, 
In which the smallest Spots improved were, 
And every Mote a Mountain did appear. 
Thus Cæsar by th'ungrateful Senate found 
His Life assaulted through his Honor's Wound. 
And now to make Him hopelesse to resist, 
You guide His Sword by Vote, which as you list 
Must Strike or Spare (for so you did enforce 
His Hand against His Reason to divorce 
Brave Strafford's Life) then wring it quite away 
By your usurping Each Militia:
Then seize His Magazines, of which possest 
You turn the Weapons 'gainst their Master's Breast. 
This done, th'unkennell'd crew of Lawless men 
Led down by Watkins, Pennington, and Ven, 
Did with confused noise the Court invade; 
Then all Dissenters in Both Houses Bay'd. 
At which the King amaz'd is forc'd to flye, 
The whilst your Mouth's laid on maintain the Cry. 
The Royal Game dislodg'd and under Chase, 
Your hot Pursute dogs Him from place to place: 
Not Saul with greater fury or disdain 
Did flying David from Jeshimon's plain 
Unto the barren Wildernesse pursue, 
Than Cours'd and Hunted is the King by you. 
The Mountain Partridge or the Chased Roe 
Might now for Emblemes of His Fortune go. 
And since all other May-games of the Town 
(Save those your selves should make) were Voted down, 
The Clam'rous Pu'pit Hollaes in resort, 
Inviting men to your King-catching Sport. 
Where as the Foyl grows cold you mend the Sent 
By crying Privilege of Parliament, 
Whose fair Pretensions the first sparkles are, 
Which by your breath blown up enflame the War, 
And Ireland (bleeding by design) the Stale 
Wherewith for Men and Mony you prevail. 
Yet doubting that Imposture could not last, 
When all the Kingdoms Mines of Treasure waste, 
You now tear down Religion's sacred Hedge 
To carry on the Work by Sacriledge; 
Reputing it Rebellions fittest Pay 
To take both God's and Cesar's dues away. 
The tenor of which execrable Vote 
Your over-active Zelots so promote, 
That neither Tomb nor Temple could escape, 
Nor Dead nor Living your Licentious Rape. 
Statues and Grave-stones o're men buried 
Rob'd of their Brass, the Coffins of their Led; 
Not the Seventh Henry's gilt and curious Skreen, 
Nor those which 'mongst our Rarities were seen, 
The Chests wherein the Saxon Monarchs lay, 
But must be basely sold or thrown away. 
May in succeeding times forgotten be 
Those bold Examples of Impiety, 
Which were the Ages wonder and discourse, 
You have Their greatest ills improv'd by worse. 
No more be mention'd Dionysius Theft,
Who of their Gold the Heathen Shrines bereft; 
For who with Yours His Robberies confer, 
Must him repute a petty Pilferer. 
Nor Julian's Scoff, who when he view'd the State 
Of Antioch's Church, the Ornaments and Plate, 
Cry'd, Meaner Vessels would serve turn, or None 
Might well become the birth of Mary's Sonn 
Nor how that spightfull Atheist did in scorn
Pisse on God's Table, which so oft had born 
The hallow'd Elements his death present: 
Nor he that fould it with his Excrement,
Then turn'd the Cloth unto that act of shame, 
Which without trembling Christians should not name. 
Nor John of Leyden, who the pillag'd Quires 
Employ'd in Munster for his own attires; 
His pranks by Hazlerig exceeded be, 
A wretch more wicked and as mad as he, 
Who once in triumph led his Sumpter Moil
Proudly bedecked with the Altar's spoil. 
Nor at Bizantium's sack how Mahomet 
In St. Sophia's Church his Horses set. 
Nor how Belshazzar at his drunken Feasts 
Carows'd in holy Vessels to his Guests: 
Nor he that did the Books and Anthems tear, 
Which in the daily Stations used were. 
These were poor Essayes of imperfect Crimes, 
Fit for beginners in unlearned times, 
Siz'd onely for that dull Meridian 
Which knew no Jesuit nor Puritan, 
(Before whose fatal Birth were no such things 
As Doctrines to Depose and Murther Kings.) 
But since Your prudent care Enacted well, 
That there should be no King in Israel, 
England must write such Annals of Your Reign 
Which all Records of elder mischiefs stain. 
Churches unbuilt by order, others burn'd; 
Whilst Pauls and Lincoln are to Stables turn'd; 
And at God's Table you might Horses see 
By (those more Beasts) their Riders manger'd be. 
Some Kitchins and some Slaughter-houses made, 
Communion-boards and Cloths for Dressers laid: 
Some turn'd to loathsome Gaols, so by you brought 
Unto the Curse of Baal's House, a Draught. 
The Common-Prayers with the Bibles torn, 
The Coaps in Antick Moorish-Dances worn, 
And sometimes for the wearers greater mock, 
The Surplice is converted to a Frock. 
Some bringing Dogs the Sacrament revile, 
Some with Copronimus the Font defile. 
O God! canst Thou these prophanations like? 
If not, why is thy Thunder slow to strike 
The cursed Authors? who dare think that Thou 
Dost, when not punish them, their acts allow. 
All which outragious Crimes, though your pretence 
Would fasten on the Soldiers insolence, 
We must believe that what by them was done 
Came licens'd forth by your probation. 
For, as your selves with Athaliah's Brood 
In strong contention for precedence stood, 
You robb'd Two Royall Chapels of their Plate,
Which Kings and Queens to God did dedicate; 
Then by a Vote more sordid than the Stealth, 
Melt down and Coin it for the Common-wealth; 
That is, give't up to the devouring jaws 
Of your great Idol Bell, new styl'd The Cause. 
And though this Monster you did well devise 
To feed by Plunder, Taxes, Loans, Excise; 
(All which Provisions You the People tell 
Scarce serve to diet Your Pantagruel.) 
We no strew'd Ashes need to trace the Cheat, 
Who plainly see what Mouthes the Messes eat. 
Brave Reformation! and a through one too, 
Which to enrich Your selves must All undo. 
Pray tell us (those that can) What fruits have grown 
From all Your Seeds in Blood and Treasure sown? 
What would you mend? when Your Projected State 
Doth from the Best in Form degenerate? 
Or why should You (of All) attempt the Cure, 
Whose Facts nor Gospels Test nor Laws endure? 
But like unwholsome Exhalations met 
From Your Conjunction onely Plagues beget, 
And in Your Circle, as Imposthumes fill 
Which by their venome the whole Body kill; 
For never had You Pow'r but to Destroy, 
Nor Will, but where You Conquer'd to Enjoy. 
This was Your Master-prize, who did intend 
To make both Churhch and Kingdom's prey Your End. 
'Gainst which the King (plac'd in the Gap) did strive 
By His (till then unquestion'd) Negative, 
Which finding You lack'd Reason to perswade, 
Your Arguments are into Weapons made; 
So to compell him by main force to yield, 
You had a Formed Army in the Field 
Before his Reared Standard could invite
Ten men upon his Righteous Cause to fight. 
Yet ere those raised Forces did advance, 
Your malice struck him dead by Ordinance, 
When your Commissions the whole Kingdom swept 
With Blood and Slaughter, Not the King Except. 
Now hardned in Revolt, You next proceed 
By Pacts to strengthen each Rebellious Deed, 
New Oaths, and Vows, and Covenants advance, 
All contradicting your Allegiance, 
Whose Sacred knot you plainly did unty, 
When you with Essex swore to Live and Die. 
These were your Calves in Bethel and in Dan, 
Which Jeroboam's Treason stablish can,
Who by strange Pacts and Altars did seduce 
The People to their Laws and and King's abuse; 
All which but serve like Soibboleth to try 
Those who pronounc'd not your Conspiracy; 
That when your other Trains defective are, 
Forc'd Oaths might bring Refusers to the Snare. 
And lest those men your Counsels did pervert, 
Might when your Fraud was seen the Cause desert, 
A fierce Decree is through the Kingdom sent, 
Which made it Death for any to Repent. 
What strange Dilemmaes doth Rebellion make? 
'Tis mortal to Deny, or to Partake: 
Some Hang who would not aid your Traiterous Act, 
Others engag'd are Hang'd if they Retract. 
So Witches who their Contracts have unsworn, 
By their own Devils are in pieces torn. 
Thus still the rageing Tempest higher grows, 
Which in Extreams the Kings Resolving throws. 
The face of Ruine every where appears, 
And Acts of Outrage multiply our fears; 
Whilst blind Ambition by Successes fed 
Hath You beyond the bound of Subjects led, 
Who tasting once the sweet of Regal Sway, 
Resolved now no longer to obey. 
For Presbyterian pride contests as high 
As doth the Popedom for Supremacy. 
Needs must you with unskilful Phaeton 
Aspire to guide the Chariot of the Sun, 
Though your ill-govern'd height with lightning be 
Thrown headlong from his burning Axle-tree. 
You will no more Petition or Debate, 
But your desire in Propositions state,
Which by such Rules and Ties the King confine, 
They in effect are Summons to Resign. 
Therefore your War is manag'd with such sleight, 
'Twas seen you more prevail'd by Purse than Might; 
And those you could not purchase to your will, 
You brib'd with sums of mony to sit still. 
The King by this time hopelesse here of Peace, 
Or to procure His wasted Peoples ease, 
Which He in frequent Messages had try'd, 
By you as oft as shamelesly deny'd; 
Wearied by faithlesse Friends and restlesse Foes, 
To certain hazard doth His Life Expose: 
When through your Quarters in a mean disguise
He to His Country-men for succour flies, 
Who met a brave occasion then to save 
Their Native King from His untimely Grave: 
Had he from them such fair reception gain'd, 
Wherewith ev'n Achish David entertain'd. 
But Faith to Him or hospitable Laws 
In your Confederate Union were no Clause, 
Which back to you their Rendred Master sends 
To tell how He was us'd among his friends. 
Far be it from my thoughts by this black Line 
To measure all within that Warlick Clime; 
The still admir'd Montross some Numbers lead 
In his brave steps of Loyalty to tread. 
I onely tax a furious Party There, 
Who with our Native Pests Enleagued were. 
Then 'twas you follow'd Him with Hue and Cry, 
Made Midnight Searches in Each Liberty, 
Voting it death to all without Reprieve, 
Who should their Master Harbor or Relieve. 
Ev'n in pure pitty of both Nations Fame, 
I wish that Act in Story had no name. 
When all your Mutual Stipulations are 
Converted at Newcastle to a Fair, 
Where (like His Lord) the King the Mart is made, 
Bought with Your Mony, and by Them Betraid; 
For both are guilty, They that did Contract, 
And You that did the fatal Bargain Act. 
Which who by equal Reason shall peruse, 
Must yet conclude, They had the best Excuse: 
For doubtlesse They (Good men) had never sold, 
But that you tempted Them with English Gold; 
And 'tis no wonder if with such a Sum 
Our Brethrens frailty might be overcome. 
What though hereafter it may prove Their Lot 
To be compared with Iscariot? 
Yet will the World perceive which was most wise, 
And who the Nobler Traitor by the Price; 
For though 'tis true Both did Themselves undo, 
They made the better Bargain of the Two, 
Which all may reckon who can difference 
Two hundred thousand Pounds from Thirty Pence. 
However something is in Justice due, 
Which may be spoken in defence of You; 
For in your Masters Purchase you gave more, 
Than all your Jewish kindred paid before. 
And had you wisely us'd what then you bought, 
Your Act might be a Loyal Ransom thought, 
To free from Bonds your Captive Soverain, 
Restoring Him to his lost Crown again. 
But You had other plots, you busie hate 
Ply'd all advantage on His fallen State, 
And shew'd You did not come to bring Him Bayl, 
But to remove Him to a stricter Gaol, 
To Holmby first, whence taken from His Bed, 
He by an Army was in triumph led; 
Till on pretence of safety Cromwel's wile 
Had juggel'd Him into the Fatal Isle, 
Where Hammond for his Jaylor is decreed, 
And Murderous Rolf as Lieger-Hangman fee'd, 
Who in one fatal Knot Two Counsels tye, 
He must by Poison or by Pistol Die. 
Here now deny'd all Comforts due to Life, 
His Friends, His Children, and His Peerlesse Wife; 
From Carisbrook He oft but vainly sends, 
And though first Wrong'd, seeks to make you Amends; 
For this He sues, and by His restlesse Pen 
Importunes Your deaf Ears to Treat agen. 
Whilst the proud Faction scorning to go lesse, 
Return those Trait'rous Votes of Non Address, 
Which follow'd were by th'Armies thundring
To Act without and quite against the King. 
Yet when that Clowd remov'd, and the clear Light, 
Drawn from His weighty Reasons, gave You sight 
Of Your own dangers, had not Their Intents 
Retarded been by some crosse Accidents; 
Which for a while with fortunate Suspense 
Check'd or diverted Their swoln Insolence: 
When the whole Kingdom for a Treaty cry'd, 
Which gave such credit to Your falling side, 
That you Recall'd those Votes, and God once more 
Your Power to save the Kingdom did restore, 
Remember how Your peevish Treators sate, 
Not to make Peace, but to prolong Debate; 
How You that precious time at first delay'd, 
And what ill use of Your advantage made, 
As if from Your foul hands God had decreed 
Nothing but War and Mischief should succeed. 
For when by easie Grants the Kings Assent 
Did your desires in greater things prevent, 
When He did yield faster than You intreat, 
And more than Modesty dares well repeat; 
Yet not content with this, without all sense, 
Or of His Honor or His Conscience, 
Still you prest on, till you too late descry'd, 
'Twas now lesse safe to stay than be deny'd. 
For like a Flood broke loose the Armed Rout, 
Then Shut Him closer up, And Shut You out, 
Who by just vengeance are since Worryed 
By those Hand-wolves You for His Ruine bred. 
Thus like Two Smoaking Firebrands, You and They 
Have in this Smother choak'd the Kingdom's Day. 
And as you rais'd Them first, must share the Guilt, 
With all the Blood in those Distractions spilt. 
For though with Sampson's Foxes backward turn'd, 
(When he Philistia's fruitful Harvest burn'd) 
The face of your opinions stands averse, 
All your Conclusions but one fire disperse; 
And every Line which carries your Designes, 
In the same Centre of Confusion joyns. 
Though then the Independents end the Work, 
'Tis known they took their Platform from the Kirk; 
Though Pilate Bradshaw with his pack of Jews 
God's High Vice-gerent at the Bar accuse, 
They but reviv'd the Evidence and Charge 
Your poys'nous Declarations laid at large; 
Though they condemn'd or made his Life their Spoil, 
You were the Setters forc'd him to the Toil: 
For you whose fatal hand the Warrant writ, 
The Prisoner did for Execution fit. 
And if their Ax invade the Regal Throat, 
Remember you first murther'd Him by Vote. 
Thus They receive Your Tennis at the bound, 
Take off that Head which you had first Un-crown'd; 
Which shews the Texture of our Mischiefs Clew, 
If ravel'd to the Top, begins in You, 
Who have forever stain'd the brave Intents 
And Credit of our English Parliaments: 
And in this One caus'd greater Ills, and more, 
Than all of theirs did Good that went before. 
Yet have you kept your word against Your will, 
Your King is Great indeed and Glorious still, 
And you have made Him so. We must impute 
That Lustre which His Sufferings contribute 
To your preposterous Wisdoms, who have done 
All your good Deeds by Contradiction: 
For as to work His Peace you rais'd this Strife, 
And often Shot at Him to Save His Life; 
As you took from Him to Encrease His wealth, 
And kept Him Pris'ner to secure His Health: 
So in revenge of your dissembled Spight, 
In this last Wrong you did Him greatest Right, 
And (cross to all you meant) by Plucking down 
Lifted Him up to His Eternal Crown. 
With This encircled in that radiant Sphear, 
Where Thy black Murtherers must ne'r appear, 
Thou from th'enthroned Martyrs Blood-stain'd Line, 
Dost in thy Vertues bright Example shine. 
And when Thy darted Beam from the moist Sky 
Nightly salutes Thy grieving Peoples Eye, 
Thou like some Warning Light rais'd by our fears, 
Shalt both provoke and still supply our Tears: 
Til the Great Prophet wak'd from his long sleep 
Again bids Sion for Josiah weep: 
That all Successions by a firm Decree 
May teach Their Children to lament for Thee. 
Beyond these mournful Rites there is no Art 
Or Cost can Thee preserve. Thy better Part 
Lives in despight of Death, and will endure 
Kept safe in Thy unpattern'd Portraicture: 
Which though in Paper drawn by thine own Hand, 
Shall longer than Corinthian-Marble stand, 
Or Iron Sculptures: There Thy matchlesse Pen 
Speaks Thee the Best of Kings as Best of Men: 
Be this Thy Epitaph: for This alone 
Deserves to carry Thy Inscription. 
And 'tis but modest Truth: so may I thrive) 
As not to please the Best of Thine Alive, 
Of flatter my dead Master, here would I 
Pay my last Duty in a Gloriovs Ly) 
In that Admired Piece the world may read 
Thy Vertues and Misfortunes Storied; 
Which bear such curious Mixture, men must doubt 
Whether Thou Wiser wert or more Devout. 
There live Blest Relick of a Saint-like mind, 
With Honors endlesse, as Thy Peace Enshrin'd. 
Whilst we, divided by that Bloody Clowd, 
Whose purple Mists Thy Murther'd Body shrowd, 
Here stay behind at gaze: Apt for Thy sake 
Unruly murmurs now 'gainst Heav'n to make, 
Which binds us to Live well, yet gives no Fense 
To guard her dearest Sons from Violence. 
But He whose Trump proclaims, Revenge is Mine, 
Bids us our Sorrow by our Hope confine, 
And reconcile our Reason to our Faith, 
Which in Thy Ruine such Concussions hath, 
It dares Conclude, God does not keep His Word 
If Zimri die in Peace that slew his Lord. ",Elegy
0,Edgar Allan Poe,"The ring is on my hand,
         And the wreath is on my brow;
       Satin and jewels grand
       Are all at my command,
         And I am happy now.

       And my lord he loves me well;
         But, when first he breathed his vow,
       I felt my bosom swell-
       For the words rang as a knell,
       And the voice seemed his who fell
       In the battle down the dell,
         And who is happy now.

       But he spoke to re-assure me,
         And he kissed my pallid brow,
       While a reverie came o'er me,
       And to the church-yard bore me,
       And I sighed to him before me,
       Thinking him dead D'Elormie,
       ""Oh, I am happy now!""

       And thus the words were spoken,
         And this the plighted vow,
       And, though my faith be broken,
       And, though my heart be broken,
       Here is a ring, as token
         That I am happy now!

       Would God I could awaken!
         For I dream I know not how!
       And my soul is sorely shaken
       Lest an evil step be taken,-
       Lest the dead who is forsaken
         May not be happy now.",Ballad
1,Federico García Lorca,"translated by Will Kirkland

The moon came into the forge
in her bustle of flowering nard.
The little boy stares at her, stares.
The boy is staring hard.
In the shaken air
the moon moves her amrs,
and shows lubricious and pure,
her breasts of hard tin.
""Moon, moon, moon, run!
If the gypsies come,
they will use your heart
to make white necklaces and rings.""
""Let me dance, my little one.
When the gypsies come,
they'll find you on the anvil
with your lively eyes closed tight.
""Moon, moon, moon, run!
I can feelheir horses come.""
""Let me be, my little one,
don't step on me, all starched and white!""

Closer comes the the horseman,
drumming on the plain.
The boy is in the forge;
his eyes are closed.
Through the olive grove
come the gypsies, dream and bronze,
their heads held high,
their hooded eyes.

Oh, how the night owl calls,
calling, calling from its tree!
The moon is climbing through the sky
with the child by the hand.

They are crying in the forge,
all the gypsies, shouting, crying.
The air is veiwing all, views all.
The air is at the viewing.",Ballad
2,Gwendolyn Brooks,"Oh mother, mother, where is happiness?
They took my lover's tallness off to war,
Left me lamenting. Now I cannot guess
What I can use an empty heart-cup for.
He won't be coming back here any more.
Some day the war will end, but, oh, I knew
When he went walking grandly out that door
That my sweet love would have to be untrue.
Would have to be untrue. Would have to court
Coquettish death, whose impudent and strange
Possessive arms and beauty (of a sort)
Can make a hard man hesitate--and change.
And he will be the one to stammer, ""Yes.""
Oh mother, mother, where is happiness?",Ballad

C. T. W.
Sometime trooper of the Royal Horse Guards
obiit H.M. prison, Reading, Berkshire
July 7, 1896)

I

He did not wear his scarlet coat,
For blood and wine are red,
And blood and wine were on his hands
When they found him with the dead,
The poor dead woman whom he loved,
And murdered in her bed.

He walked amongst the Trial Men
In a suit of shabby grey;
A cricket cap was on his head,
And his step seemed light and gay;
But I never saw a man who looked
So wistfully at the day.

I never saw a man who looked
With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
Which prisoners call the sky,
And at every drifting cloud that went
With sails of silver by.

I walked, with other souls in pain,
Within another ring,
And was wondering if the man had done
A great or little thing,
When a voice behind me whispered low,
'THAT FELLOW'S GOT TO SWING.'

Dear Christ! the very prison walls
Suddenly seemed to reel,
And the sky above my head became
Like a casque of scorching steel;
And, though I was a soul in pain,
My pain I could not feel.

I only knew what hunted thought
Quickened his step, and why
He looked upon the garish day
With such a wistful eye;
The man had killed the thing he loved,
And so he had to die.


Yet each man kills the thing he loves,
By each let this be heard,
Some do it with a bitter look,
Some with a flattering word,
The coward does it with a kiss,
The brave man with a sword!

Some kill their love when they are young,
And some when they are old;
Some strangle with the hands of Lust,
Some with the hands of Gold:
The kindest use a knife, because
The dead so soon grow cold.

Some love too little, some too long,
Some sell, and others buy;
Some do the deed with many tears,
And some without a sigh:
For each man kills the thing he loves,
Yet each man does not die.

He does not die a death of shame
On a day of dark disgrace,
Nor have a noose about his neck,
Nor a cloth upon his face,
Nor drop feet foremost through the floor
Into an empty space.


He does not sit with silent men
Who watch him night and day;
Who watch him when he tries to weep,
And when he tries to pray;
Who watch him lest himself should rob
The prison of its prey.

He does not wake at dawn to see
Dread figures throng his room,
The shivering Chaplain robed in white,
The Sheriff stern with gloom,
And the Governor all in shiny black,
With the yellow face of Doom.

He does not rise in piteous haste
To put on convict-clothes,
While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats,
and notes
Each new and nerve-twitched pose,
Fingering a watch whose little ticks
Are like horrible hammer-blows.

He does not know that sickening thirst
That sands one's throat, before
The hangman with his gardener's gloves
Slips through the padded door,
And binds one with three leathern thongs,
That the throat may thirst no more.

He does not bend his head to hear
The Burial Office read,
Nor, while the terror of his soul
Tells him he is not dead,
Cross his own coffin, as he moves
Into the hideous shed.

He does not stare upon the air
Through a little roof of glass:
He does not pray with lips of clay
For his agony to pass;
Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek
The kiss of Caiaphas.


II


Six weeks our guardsman walked the yard,
In the suit of shabby grey:
His cricket cap was on his head,
And his step seemed light and gay,
But I never saw a man who looked
So wistfully at the day.

I never saw a man who looked
With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
Which prisoners call the sky,
And at every wandering cloud that trailed
Its ravelled fleeces by.

He did not wring his hands, as do
Those witless men who dare
To try to rear the changeling Hope
In the cave of black Despair:
He only looked upon the sun,
And drank the morning air.

He did not wring his hands nor weep,
Nor did he peek or pine,
But he drank the air as though it held
Some healthful anodyne;
With open mouth he drank the sun
As though it had been wine!

And I and all the souls in pain,
Who tramped the other ring,
Forgot if we ourselves had done
A great or little thing,
And watched with gaze of dull amaze
The man who had to swing.

And strange it was to see him pass
With a step so light and gay,
And strange it was to see him look
So wistfully at the day,
And strange it was to think that he
Had such a debt to pay.


For oak and elm have pleasant leaves
That in the springtime shoot:
But grim to see is the gallows-tree,
With its adder-bitten root,
And, green or dry, a man must die
Before it bears its fruit!

The loftiest place is that seat of grace
For which all worldlings try:
But who would stand in hempen band
Upon a scaffold high,
And through a murderer's collar take
His last look at the sky?

It is sweet to dance to violins
When Love and Life are fair:
To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes
Is delicate and rare:
But it is not sweet with nimble feet
To dance upon the air!

So with curious eyes and sick surmise
We watched him day by day,
And wondered if each one of us
Would end the self-same way,
For none can tell to what red Hell
His sightless soul may stray.

At last the dead man walked no more
Amongst the Trial Men,
And I knew that he was standing up
In the black dock's dreadful pen,
And that never would I see his face
In God's sweet world again.

Like two doomed ships that pass in storm
We had crossed each other's way:
But we made no sign, we said no word,
We had no word to say;
For we did not meet in the holy night,
But in the shameful day.

A prison wall was round us both,
Two outcast men we were:
The world had thrust us from its heart,
And God from out His care:
And the iron gin that waits for Sin
Had caught us in its snare.


III


In Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,
And the dripping wall is high,
So it was there he took the air
Beneath the leaden sky,
And by each side a Warder walked,
For fear the man might die.

Or else he sat with those who watched
His anguish night and day;
Who watched him when he rose to weep,
And when he crouched to pray;
Who watched him lest himself should rob
Their scaffold of its prey.

The Governor was strong upon
The Regulations Act:
The Doctor said that Death was but
A scientific fact:
And twice a day the Chaplain called,
And left a little tract.

And twice a day he smoked his pipe,
And drank his quart of beer:
His soul was resolute, and held
No hiding-place for fear;
He often said that he was glad
The hangman's hands were near.

But why he said so strange a thing
No Warder dared to ask:
For he to whom a watcher's doom
Is given as his task,
Must set a lock upon his lips,
And make his face a mask.

Or else he might be moved, and try
To comfort or console:
And what should Human Pity do
Pent up in Murderers' Hole?
What word of grace in such a place
Could help a brother's soul?


With slouch and swing around the ring
We trod the Fools' Parade!
We did not care: we knew we were
The Devil's Own Brigade:
And shaven head and feet of lead
Make a merry masquerade.

We tore the tarry rope to shreds
With blunt and bleeding nails;
We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,
And cleaned the shining rails:
And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,
And clattered with the pails.

We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,
We turned the dusty drill:
We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,
And sweated on the mill:
But in the heart of every man
Terror was lying still.

So still it lay that every day
Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:
And we forgot the bitter lot
That waits for fool and knave,
Till once, as we tramped in from work,
We passed an open grave.

With yawning mouth the yellow hole
Gaped for a living thing;
The very mud cried out for blood
To the thirsty asphalte ring:
And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair
Some prisoner had to swing.

Right in we went, with soul intent
On Death and Dread and Doom:
The hangman, with his little bag,
Went shuffling through the gloom:
And each man trembled as he crept
Into his numbered tomb.


That night the empty corridors
Were full of forms of Fear,
And up and down the iron town
Stole feet we could not hear,
And through the bars that hide the stars
White faces seemed to peer.

He lay as one who lies and dreams
In a pleasant meadow-land,
The watchers watched him as he slept,
And could not understand
How one could sleep so sweet a sleep
With a hangman close at hand.

But there is no sleep when men must weep
Who never yet have wept:
So we - the fool, the fraud, the knave -
That endless vigil kept,
And through each brain on hands of pain
Another's terror crept.

Alas! it is a fearful thing
To feel another's guilt!
For, right within, the sword of Sin
Pierced to its poisoned hilt,
And as molten lead were the tears we shed
For the blood we had not spilt.

The Warders with their shoes of felt
Crept by each padlocked door,
And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,
Grey figures on the floor,
And wondered why men knelt to pray
Who never prayed before.

All through the night we knelt and prayed,
Mad mourners of a corse!
The troubled plumes of midnight were
The plumes upon a hearse:
And bitter wine upon a sponge
Was the savour of Remorse.


The grey cock crew, the red cock crew,
But never came the day:
And crooked shapes of Terror crouched,
In the corners where we lay:
And each evil sprite that walks by night
Before us seemed to play.

They glided past, they glided fast,
Like travellers through a mist:
They mocked the moon in a rigadoon
Of delicate turn and twist,
And with formal pace and loathsome grace
The phantoms kept their tryst.

With mop and mow, we saw them go,
Slim shadows hand in hand:
About, about, in ghostly rout
They trod a saraband:
And the damned grotesques made arabesques,
Like the wind upon the sand!

With the pirouettes of marionettes,
They tripped on pointed tread:
But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,
As their grisly masque they led,
And loud they sang, and long they sang,
For they sang to wake the dead.

'Oho!' they cried, 'The world is wide,
But fettered limbs go lame!
And once, or twice, to throw the dice
Is a gentlemanly game,
But he does not win who plays with Sin
In the secret House of Shame.'

No things of air these antics were,
That frolicked with such glee:
To men whose lives were held in gyves,
And whose feet might not go free,
Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,
Most terrible to see.

Around, around, they waltzed and wound;
Some wheeled in smirking pairs;
With the mincing step of a demirep
Some sidled up the stairs:
And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,
Each helped us at our prayers.

The morning wind began to moan,
But still the night went on:
Through its giant loom the web of gloom
Crept till each thread was spun:
And, as we prayed, we grew afraid
Of the Justice of the Sun.

The moaning wind went wandering round
The weeping prison-wall:
Till like a wheel of turning steel
We felt the minutes crawl:
O moaning wind! what had we done
To have such a seneschal?

At last I saw the shadowed bars,
Like a lattice wrought in lead,
Move right across the whitewashed wall
That faced my three-plank bed,
And I knew that somewhere in the world
God's dreadful dawn was red.

At six o'clock we cleaned our cells,
At seven all was still,
But the sough and swing of a mighty wing
The prison seemed to fill,
For the Lord of Death with icy breath
Had entered in to kill.

He did not pass in purple pomp,
Nor ride a moon-white steed.
Three yards of cord and a sliding board
Are all the gallows' need:
So with rope of shame the Herald came
To do the secret deed.

We were as men who through a fen
Of filthy darkness grope:
We did not dare to breathe a prayer,
Or to give our anguish scope:
Something was dead in each of us,
And what was dead was Hope.

For Man's grim Justice goes its way,
And will not swerve aside:
It slays the weak, it slays the strong,
It has a deadly stride:
With iron heel it slays the strong,
The monstrous parricide!

We waited for the stroke of eight:
Each tongue was thick with thirst:
For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate
That makes a man accursed,
And Fate will use a running noose
For the best man and the worst.

We had no other thing to do,
Save to wait for the sign to come:
So, like things of stone in a valley lone,
Quiet we sat and dumb:
But each man's heart beat thick and quick,
Like a madman on a drum!

With sudden shock the prison-clock
Smote on the shivering air,
And from all the gaol rose up a wail
Of impotent despair,
Like the sound that frightened marshes hear
From some leper in his lair.

And as one sees most fearful things
In the crystal of a dream,
We saw the greasy hempen rope
Hooked to the blackened beam,
And heard the prayer the hangman's snare
Strangled into a scream.

And all the woe that moved him so
That he gave that bitter cry,
And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,
None knew so well as I:
For he who lives more lives than one
More deaths than one must die.


IV


There is no chapel on the day
On which they hang a man:
The Chaplain's heart is far too sick,
Or his face is far too wan,
Or there is that written in his eyes
Which none should look upon.

So they kept us close till nigh on noon,
And then they rang the bell,
And the Warders with their jingling keys
Opened each listening cell,
And down the iron stair we tramped,
Each from his separate Hell.

Out into God's sweet air we went,
But not in wonted way,
For this man's face was white with fear,
And that man's face was grey,
And I never saw sad men who looked
So wistfully at the day.

I never saw sad men who looked
With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
We prisoners called the sky,
And at every careless cloud that passed
In happy freedom by.

But there were those amongst us all
Who walked with downcast head,
And knew that, had each got his due,
They should have died instead:
He had but killed a thing that lived,
Whilst they had killed the dead.

For he who sins a second time
Wakes a dead soul to pain,
And draws it from its spotted shroud,
And makes it bleed again,
And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,
And makes it bleed in vain!


Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb
With crooked arrows starred,
Silently we went round and round
The slippery asphalte yard;
Silently we went round and round,
And no man spoke a word.

Silently we went round and round,
And through each hollow mind
The Memory of dreadful things
Rushed like a dreadful wind,
And Horror stalked before each man,
And Terror crept behind.


The Warders strutted up and down,
And kept their herd of brutes,
Their uniforms were spick and span,
And they wore their Sunday suits,
But we knew the work they had been at,
By the quicklime on their boots.

For where a grave had opened wide,
There was no grave at all:
Only a stretch of mud and sand
By the hideous prison-wall,
And a little heap of burning lime,
That the man should have his pall.

For he has a pall, this wretched man,
Such as few men can claim:
Deep down below a prison-yard,
Naked for greater shame,
He lies, with fetters on each foot,
Wrapt in a sheet of flame!

And all the while the burning lime
Eats flesh and bone away,
It eats the brittle bone by night,
And the soft flesh by day,
It eats the flesh and bone by turns,
But it eats the heart alway.


For three long years they will not sow
Or root or seedling there:
For three long years the unblessed spot
Will sterile be and bare,
And look upon the wondering sky
With unreproachful stare.

They think a murderer's heart would taint
Each simple seed they sow.
It is not true! God's kindly earth
Is kindlier than men know,
And the red rose would but blow more red,
The white rose whiter blow.

Out of his mouth a red, red rose!
Out of his heart a white!
For who can say by what strange way,
Christ brings His will to light,
Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore
Bloomed in the great Pope's sight?

But neither milk-white rose nor red
May bloom in prison-air;
The shard, the pebble, and the flint,
Are what they give us there:
For flowers have been known to heal
A common man's despair.

So never will wine-red rose or white,
Petal by petal, fall
On that stretch of mud and sand that lies
By the hideous prison-wall,
To tell the men who tramp the yard
That God's Son died for all.


Yet though the hideous prison-wall
Still hems him round and round,
And a spirit may not walk by night
That is with fetters bound,
And a spirit may but weep that lies
In such unholy ground,

He is at peace - this wretched man -
At peace, or will be soon:
There is no thing to make him mad,
Nor does Terror walk at noon,
For the lampless Earth in which he lies
Has neither Sun nor Moon.

They hanged him as a beast is hanged:
They did not even toll
A requiem that might have brought
Rest to his startled soul,
But hurriedly they took him out,
And hid him in a hole.

They stripped him of his canvas clothes,
And gave him to the flies:
They mocked the swollen purple throat,
And the stark and staring eyes:
And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud
In which their convict lies.

The Chaplain would not kneel to pray
By his dishonoured grave:
Nor mark it with that blessed Cross
That Christ for sinners gave,
Because the man was one of those
Whom Christ came down to save.

Yet all is well; he has but passed
To Life's appointed bourne:
And alien tears will fill for him
Pity's long-broken urn,
For his mourners will be outcast men,
And outcasts always mourn


V


I know not whether Laws be right,
Or whether Laws be wrong;
All that we know who lie in gaol
Is that the wall is strong;
And that each day is like a year,
A year whose days are long.

But this I know, that every Law
That men have made for Man,
Since first Man took his brother's life,
And the sad world began,
But straws the wheat and saves the chaff
With a most evil fan.

This too I know - and wise it were
If each could know the same -
That every prison that men build
Is built with bricks of shame,
And bound with bars lest Christ should see
How men their brothers maim.

With bars they blur the gracious moon,
And blind the goodly sun:
And they do well to hide their Hell,
For in it things are done
That Son of God nor son of Man
Ever should look upon!


The vilest deeds like poison weeds,
Bloom well in prison-air;
It is only what is good in Man
That wastes and withers there:
Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,
And the Warder is Despair.

For they starve the little frightened child
Till it weeps both night and day:
And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,
And gibe the old and grey,
And some grow mad, and all grow bad,
And none a word may say.

Each narrow cell in which we dwell
Is a foul and dark latrine,
And the fetid breath of living Death
Chokes up each grated screen,
And all, but Lust, is turned to dust
In Humanity's machine.

The brackish water that we drink
Creeps with a loathsome slime,
And the bitter bread they weigh in scales
Is full of chalk and lime,
And Sleep will not lie down, but walks
Wild-eyed, and cries to Time.


But though lean Hunger and green Thirst
Like asp with adder fight,
We have little care of prison fare,
For what chills and kills outright
Is that every stone one lifts by day
Becomes one's heart by night.

With midnight always in one's heart,
And twilight in one's cell,
We turn the crank, or tear the rope,
Each in his separate Hell,
And the silence is more awful far
Than the sound of a brazen bell.

And never a human voice comes near
To speak a gentle word:
And the eye that watches through the door
Is pitiless and hard:
And by all forgot, we rot and rot,
With soul and body marred.

And thus we rust Life's iron chain
Degraded and alone:
And some men curse, and some men weep,
And some men make no moan:
But God's eternal Laws are kind
And break the heart of stone.


And every human heart that breaks,
In prison-cell or yard,
Is as that broken box that gave
Its treasure to the Lord,
And filled the unclean leper's house
With the scent of costliest nard.

Ah! happy they whose hearts can break
And peace of pardon win!
How else may man make straight his plan
And cleanse his soul from Sin?
How else but through a broken heart
May Lord Christ enter in?


And he of the swollen purple throat,
And the stark and staring eyes,
Waits for the holy hands that took
The Thief to Paradise;
And a broken and a contrite heart
The Lord will not despise.

The man in red who reads the Law
Gave him three weeks of life,
Three little weeks in which to heal
His soul of his soul's strife,
And cleanse from every blot of blood
The hand that held the knife.

And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,
The hand that held the steel:
For only blood can wipe out blood,
And only tears can heal:
And the crimson stain that was of Cain
Became Christ's snow-white seal.


VI


In Reading gaol by Reading town
There is a pit of shame,
And in it lies a wretched man
Eaten by teeth of flame,
In a burning winding-sheet he lies,
And his grave has got no name.

And there, till Christ call forth the dead,
In silence let him lie:
No need to waste the foolish tear,
Or heave the windy sigh:
The man had killed the thing he loved,
And so he had to die.

And all men kill the thing they love,
By all let this be heard,
Some do it with a bitter look,
Some with a flattering word,
The coward does it with a kiss,
The brave man with a sword!",Ballad
4,Gwendolyn Brooks,"Rudolph Reed was oaken.
His wife was oaken too.
And his two good girls and his good little man
Oakened as they grew.

""I am not hungry for berries.
I am not hungry for bread.
But hungry hungry for a house
Where at night a man in bed

""May never hear the plaster
Stir as if in pain.
May never hear the roaches
Falling like fat rain.

""Where never wife and children need
Go blinking through the gloom.
Where every room of many rooms
Will be full of room.

""Oh my home may have its east or west
Or north or south behind it.
All I know is I shall know it,
And fight for it when I find it.""

The agent's steep and steady stare
Corroded to a grin.
Why you black old, tough old hell of a man,
Move your family in!

Nary a grin grinned Rudolph Reed,
Nary a curse cursed he,
But moved in his House. With his dark little wife,
And his dark little children three.

A neighbor would look, with a yawning eye
That squeezed into a slit.
But the Rudolph Reeds and children three
Were too joyous to notice it.

For were they not firm in a home of their own
With windows everywhere
And a beautiful banistered stair
And a front yard for flowers and a back for grass?

The first night, a rock, big as two fists.
The second, a rock big as three.
But nary a curse cursed Rudolph Reed.
(Though oaken as man could be.)

The third night, a silvery ring of glass.
Patience arched to endure,
But he looked, and lo! small Mabel's blood
Was staining her gaze so pure.

Then up did rise our Roodoplh Reed
And pressed the hand of his wife,
And went to the door with a thirty-four
And a beastly butcher knife.

He ran like a mad thing into the night
And the words in his mouth were stinking.
By the time he had hurt his first white man
He was no longer thinking.

By the time he had hurt his fourth white man
Rudolph Reed was dead.
His neighbors gathered and kicked his corpse.
""Nigger--"" his neighbors said.

Small Mabel whimpered all night long,
For calling herself the cause.
Her oak-eyed mother did no thing
But change the bloody gauze.",Ballad
5,Algernon Charles Swinburne,"I hid my heart in a nest of roses,
Out of the sun's way, hidden apart;
In a softer bed than the soft white snow's is,
Under the roses I hid my heart.
Why would it sleep not? why should it start,
When never a leaf of the rose-tree stirred?
What made sleep flutter his wings and part?
Only the song of a secret bird.

Lie still, I said, for the wind's wing closes,
And mild leaves muffle the keen sun's dart;
Lie still, for the wind on the warm seas dozes,
And the wind is unquieter yet than thou art.
Does a thought in thee still as a thorn's wound smart?
Does the fang still fret thee of hope deferred?
What bids the lips of thy sleep dispart?
Only the song of a secret bird.

The green land's name that a charm encloses, 
It never was writ in the traveller's chart,
And sweet on its trees as the fruit that grows is,
It never was sold in the merchant's mart.
The swallows of dreams through its dim fields dart,
And sleep's are the tunes in its tree-tops heard;
No hound's note wakens the wildwood hart,
Only the song of a secret bird.


ENVOI

In the world of dreams I have chosen my part,
To sleep for a season and hear no word
Of true love's truth or of light love's art,
Only the song of a secret bird.",Ballad
6,Sara Teasdale,"Two knights rode forth at early dawn 
A-seeking maids to wed, 
Said one, ""My lady must be fair, 
With gold hair on her head.""

Then spake the other knight-at-arms: 
""I care not for her face, 
But she I love must be a dove 
For purity and grace.""

And each knight blew upon his horn 
And went his separate way, 
And each knight found a lady-love 
Before the fall of day.

But she was brown who should have had 
The shining yellow hair -- 
I ween the knights forgot their words 
Or else they ceased to care.

For he who wanted purity 
Brought home a wanton wild, 
And when each saw the other knight 
I ween that each knight smiled.",Ballad
7,Algernon Charles Swinburne,"Kneel down, fair Love, and fill thyself with tears,
Girdle thyself with sighing for a girth
Upon the sides of mirth,
Cover thy lips and eyelids, let thine ears
Be filled with rumour of people sorrowing;
Make thee soft raiment out of woven sighs
Upon the flesh to cleave,
Set pains therein and many a grievous thing,
And many sorrows after each his wise
For armlet and for gorget and for sleeve. 

O Love's lute heard about the lands of death,
Left hanged upon the trees that were therein;
O Love and Time and Sin,
Three singing mouths that mourn now underbreath,
Three lovers, each one evil spoken of;
O smitten lips wherethrough this voice of mine
Came softer with her praise;
Abide a little for our lady's love.
The kisses of her mouth were more than wine,
And more than peace the passage of her days. 

O Love, thou knowest if she were good to see.
O Time, thou shalt not find in any land
Till, cast out of thine hand,
The sunlight and the moonlight fail from thee,
Another woman fashioned like as this.
O Sin, thou knowest that all thy shame in her
Was made a goodly thing;
Yea, she caught Shame and shamed him with her kiss,
With her fair kiss, and lips much lovelier
Than lips of amorous roses in late spring. 

By night there stood over against my bed
Queen Venus with a hood striped gold and black,
Both sides drawn fully back
From brows wherein the sad blood failed of red,
And temples drained of purple and full of death.
Her curled hair had the wave of sea-water
And the sea's gold in it.
Her eyes were as a dove's that sickeneth.
Strewn dust of gold she had shed over her,
And pearl and purple and amber on her feet. 

Upon her raiment of dyed sendaline
Were painted all the secret ways of love
And covered things thereof,
That hold delight as grape-flowers hold their wine;
Red mouths of maidens and red feet of doves,
And brides that kept within the bride-chamber
Their garment of soft shame,
And weeping faces of the wearied loves
That swoon in sleep and awake wearier,
With heat of lips and hair shed out like flame. 

The tears that through her eyelids fell on me
Made mine own bitter where they ran between
As blood had fallen therein,
She saying; Arise, lift up thine eyes and see
If any glad thing be or any good
Now the best thing is taken forth of us;
Even she to whom all praise
Was as one flower in a great multitude,
One glorious flower of many and glorious,
One day found gracious among many days: 

Even she whose handmaiden was Love--to whom
At kissing times across her stateliest bed
Kings bowed themselves and shed
Pale wine, and honey with the honeycomb,
And spikenard bruised for a burnt-offering;
Even she between whose lips the kiss became
As fire and frankincense;
Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king,
Whose eyes were as the morning purged with flame,
Whose eyelids as sweet savour issuing thence. 

Then I beheld, and lo on the other side
My lady's likeness crowned and robed and dead.
Sweet still, but now not red,
Was the shut mouth whereby men lived and died.
And sweet, but emptied of the blood's blue shade,
The great curled eyelids that withheld her eyes.
And sweet, but like spoilt gold,
The weight of colour in her tresses weighed.
And sweet, but as a vesture with new dyes,
The body that was clothed with love of old. 

Ah! that my tears filled all her woven hair
And all the hollow bosom of her gown--
Ah! that my tears ran down
Even to the place where many kisses were,
Even where her parted breast-flowers have place,
Even where they are cloven apart--who knows not this?
Ah! the flowers cleave apart
And their sweet fills the tender interspace;
Ah! the leaves grown thereof were things to kiss
Ere their fine gold was tarnished at the heart. 

Ah! in the days when God did good to me,
Each part about her was a righteous thing;
Her mouth an almsgiving,
The glory of her garments charity,
The beauty of her bosom a good deed,
In the good days when God kept sight of us;
Love lay upon her eyes,
And on that hair whereof the world takes heed;
And all her body was more virtuous
Than souls of women fashioned otherwise. 

Now, ballad, gather poppies in thine hands
And sheaves of brier and many rusted sheaves
Rain-rotten in rank lands,
Waste marigold and late unhappy leaves
And grass that fades ere any of it be mown;
And when thy bosom is filled full thereof
Seek out Death's face ere the light altereth,
And say ""My master that was thrall to Love
Is become thrall to Death.""
Bow down before him, ballad, sigh and groan.
But make no sojourn in thy outgoing;
For haply it may be
That when thy feet return at evening
Death shall come in with thee.",Ballad
8,Langston Hughes,"Landlord, landlord,
My roof has sprung a leak.
Don't you 'member I told you about it
Way last week?

It's a wonder you don't fall down.

Ten Bucks you say I owe you?
Ten Bucks you say is due?
Well, that's Ten Bucks more'n I'l pay you
Till you fix this house up new.

What? You gonna get eviction orders?
You gonna cut off my heat?
You gonna take my furniture and
Throw it in the street?

9,Geoffrey Chaucer,"The firste stock-father of gentleness,
What man desireth gentle for to be,
Must follow his trace, and all his wittes dress,
Virtue to love, and vices for to flee;
For unto virtue longeth dignity,
And not the reverse, safely dare I deem,
All wear he mitre, crown, or diademe.

This firste stock was full of righteousness,
True of his word, sober, pious, and free,
Clean of his ghost, and loved business,
Against the vice of sloth, in honesty;
And, but his heir love virtue as did he,
He is not gentle, though he riche seem,
All wear he mitre, crown, or diademe.

Vice may well be heir to old richess,
But there may no man, as men may well see,
Bequeath his heir his virtuous nobless;
That is appropried to no degree,
But to the first Father in majesty,
Which makes his heire him that doth him queme,
All wear he mitre, crown, or diademe.",Ballad
10,Edgar Allan Poe,"The skies they were ashen and sober;
          The leaves they were crisped and sere-
          The leaves they were withering and sere;
      It was night in the lonesome October
          Of my most immemorial year;
      It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,
          In the misty mid region of Weir-
      It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,
          In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

      Here once, through an alley Titanic,
          Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul-
          Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.
      There were days when my heart was volcanic
          As the scoriac rivers that roll-
          As the lavas that restlessly roll
      Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek
          In the ultimate climes of the pole-
      That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
          In the realms of the boreal pole.

      Our talk had been serious and sober,
          But our thoughts they were palsied and sere-
          Our memories were treacherous and sere-
      For we knew not the month was October,
          And we marked not the night of the year-
          (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)
      We noted not the dim lake of Auber-
          (Though once we had journeyed down here),
      Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,
          Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

      And now, as the night was senescent,
          And star-dials pointed to morn-
          As the star-dials hinted of morn-
      At the end of our path a liquescent
          And nebulous lustre was born,
      Out of which a miraculous crescent
          Arose with a duplicate horn-
      Astarte's bediamonded crescent
          Distinct with its duplicate horn.

      And I said- 'She is warmer than Dian:
          She rolls through an ether of sighs-
          She revels in a region of sighs:
      She has seen that the tears are not dry on
          These cheeks, where the worm never dies,
      And has come past the stars of the Lion,
          To point us the path to the skies-
          To the Lethean peace of the skies-
      Come up, in despite of the Lion,
          To shine on us with her bright eyes-
      Come up through the lair of the Lion,
          With love in her luminous eyes.'

      But Psyche, uplifting her finger,
          Said- 'Sadly this star I mistrust-
          Her pallor I strangely mistrust:-
      Oh, hasten!- oh, let us not linger!
          Oh, fly!- let us fly!- for we must.'
      In terror she spoke, letting sink her
          Wings until they trailed in the dust-
      In agony sobbed, letting sink her
          Plumes till they trailed in the dust-
          Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.

      I replied- 'This is nothing but dreaming:
          Let us on by this tremulous light!
          Let us bathe in this crystalline light!
      Its Sybilic splendor is beaming
          With Hope and in Beauty to-night:-
          See!- it flickers up the sky through the night!
      Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,
          And be sure it will lead us aright-
      We safely may trust to a gleaming
          That cannot but guide us aright,
          Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.'

      Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,
          And tempted her out of her gloom-
          And conquered her scruples and gloom;
      And we passed to the end of the vista,
          But were stopped by the door of a tomb-
          By the door of a legended tomb;
      And I said- 'What is written, sweet sister,
          On the door of this legended tomb?'
          She replied- 'Ulalume- Ulalume-
          'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!'

      Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
          As the leaves that were crisped and sere-
          As the leaves that were withering and sere-
      And I cried- 'It was surely October
          On this very night of last year
          That I journeyed- I journeyed down here-
          That I brought a dread burden down here-
          On this night of all nights in the year,
          Ah, what demon has tempted me here?
      Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber-
          This misty mid region of Weir-
      Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber,
          This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.'",Ballad
11,Allen Ginsberg,"I speak of love that comes to mind: 
The moon is faithful, although blind; 
She moves in thought she cannot speak. 
Perfect care has made her bleak. 

I never dreamed the sea so deep, 
The earth so dark; so long my sleep, 
I have become another child. 
I wake to see the world go wild.",Ballad
12,Dylan Thomas,"The bows glided down, and the coast
Blackened with birds took a last look
At his thrashing hair and whale-blue eye;
The trodden town rang its cobbles for luck.

Then good-bye to the fishermanned
Boat with its anchor free and fast
As a bird hooking over the sea,
High and dry by the top of the mast,

Whispered the affectionate sand
And the bulwarks of the dazzled quay.
For my sake sail, and never look back,
Said the looking land.

Sails drank the wind, and white as milk
He sped into the drinking dark;
The sun shipwrecked west on a pearl
And the moon swam out of its hulk.

Funnels and masts went by in a whirl.
Good-bye to the man on the sea-legged deck
To the gold gut that sings on his reel
To the bait that stalked out of the sack,

For we saw him throw to the swift flood
A girl alive with his hooks through her lips;
All the fishes were rayed in blood,
Said the dwindling ships.

Good-bye to chimneys and funnels,
Old wives that spin in the smoke,
He was blind to the eyes of candles
In the praying windows of waves

But heard his bait buck in the wake
And tussle in a shoal of loves.
Now cast down your rod, for the whole
Of the sea is hilly with whales,

She longs among horses and angels,
The rainbow-fish bend in her joys,
Floated the lost cathedral
Chimes of the rocked buoys.

Where the anchor rode like a gull
Miles over the moonstruck boat
A squall of birds bellowed and fell,
A cloud blew the rain from its throat;

He saw the storm smoke out to kill
With fuming bows and ram of ice,
Fire on starlight, rake Jesu's stream;
And nothing shone on the water's face

But the oil and bubble of the moon,
Plunging and piercing in his course
The lured fish under the foam
Witnessed with a kiss.

Whales in the wake like capes and Alps
Quaked the sick sea and snouted deep,
Deep the great bushed bait with raining lips
Slipped the fins of those humpbacked tons

And fled their love in a weaving dip.
Oh, Jericho was falling in their lungs!
She nipped and dived in the nick of love,
Spun on a spout like a long-legged ball

Till every beast blared down in a swerve
Till every turtle crushed from his shell
Till every bone in the rushing grave
Rose and crowed and fell!

Good luck to the hand on the rod,
There is thunder under its thumbs;
Gold gut is a lightning thread,
His fiery reel sings off its flames,

The whirled boat in the burn of his blood
Is crying from nets to knives,
Oh the shearwater birds and their boatsized brood
Oh the bulls of Biscay and their calves

Are making under the green, laid veil
The long-legged beautiful bait their wives.
Break the black news and paint on a sail
Huge weddings in the waves,

Over the wakeward-flashing spray
Over the gardens of the floor
Clash out the mounting dolphin's day,
My mast is a bell-spire,

Strike and smoothe, for my decks are drums,
Sing through the water-spoken prow
The octopus walking into her limbs
The polar eagle with his tread of snow.

From salt-lipped beak to the kick of the stern
Sing how the seal has kissed her dead!
The long, laid minute's bride drifts on
Old in her cruel bed.

Over the graveyard in the water
Mountains and galleries beneath
Nightingale and hyena
Rejoicing for that drifting death

Sing and howl through sand and anemone
Valley and sahara in a shell,
Oh all the wanting flesh his enemy
Thrown to the sea in the shell of a girl


Is old as water and plain as an eel;
Always good-bye to the long-legged bread
Scattered in the paths of his heels
For the salty birds fluttered and fed

And the tall grains foamed in their bills;
Always good-bye to the fires of the face,
For the crab-backed dead on the sea-bed rose
And scuttled over her eyes,

The blind, clawed stare is cold as sleet.
The tempter under the eyelid
Who shows to the selves asleep
Mast-high moon-white women naked

Walking in wishes and lovely for shame
Is dumb and gone with his flame of brides.
Susannah's drowned in the bearded stream
And no-one stirs at Sheba's side

But the hungry kings of the tides;
Sin who had a woman's shape
Sleeps till Silence blows on a cloud
And all the lifted waters walk and leap.

Lucifer that bird's dropping
Out of the sides of the north
Has melted away and is lost
Is always lost in her vaulted breath,

Venus lies star-struck in her wound
And the sensual ruins make
Seasons over the liquid world,
White springs in the dark.

Always good-bye, cried the voices through the shell,
Good-bye always, for the flesh is cast
And the fisherman winds his reel
With no more desire than a ghost.

Always good luck, praised the finned in the feather
Bird after dark and the laughing fish
As the sails drank up the hail of thunder
And the long-tailed lightning lit his catch.

The boat swims into the six-year weather,
A wind throws a shadow and it freezes fast.
See what the gold gut drags from under
Mountains and galleries to the crest!

See what clings to hair and skull
As the boat skims on with drinking wings!
The statues of great rain stand still,
And the flakes fall like hills.

Sing and strike his heavy haul
Toppling up the boatside in a snow of light!
His decks are drenched with miracles.
Oh miracle of fishes! The long dead bite!

Out of the urn a size of a man
Out of the room the weight of his trouble
Out of the house that holds a town
In the continent of a fossil

One by one in dust and shawl,
Dry as echoes and insect-faced,
His fathers cling to the hand of the girl
And the dead hand leads the past,

Leads them as children and as air
On to the blindly tossing tops;
The centuries throw back their hair
And the old men sing from newborn lips:

Time is bearing another son.
Kill Time! She turns in her pain!
The oak is felled in the acorn
And the hawk in the egg kills the wren.

He who blew the great fire in
And died on a hiss of flames
Or walked the earth in the evening
Counting the denials of the grains

Clings to her drifting hair, and climbs;
And he who taught their lips to sing
Weeps like the risen sun among
The liquid choirs of his tribes.

The rod bends low, divining land,
And through the sundered water crawls
A garden holding to her hand
With birds and animals

With men and women and waterfalls
Trees cool and dry in the whirlpool of ships
And stunned and still on the green, laid veil
Sand with legends in its virgin laps

And prophets loud on the burned dunes;
Insects and valleys hold her thighs hard,
Times and places grip her breast bone,
She is breaking with seasons and clouds;

Round her trailed wrist fresh water weaves,
with moving fish and rounded stones
Up and down the greater waves
A separate river breathes and runs;

Strike and sing his catch of fields
For the surge is sown with barley,
The cattle graze on the covered foam,
The hills have footed the waves away,

With wild sea fillies and soaking bridles
With salty colts and gales in their limbs
All the horses of his haul of miracles
Gallop through the arched, green farms,

Trot and gallop with gulls upon them
And thunderbolts in their manes.
O Rome and Sodom To-morrow and London
The country tide is cobbled with towns

And steeples pierce the cloud on her shoulder
And the streets that the fisherman combed
When his long-legged flesh was a wind on fire
And his loin was a hunting flame

Coil from the thoroughfares of her hair
And terribly lead him home alive
Lead her prodigal home to his terror,
The furious ox-killing house of love.

Down, down, down, under the ground,
Under the floating villages,
Turns the moon-chained and water-wound
Metropolis of fishes,

There is nothing left of the sea but its sound,
Under the earth the loud sea walks,
In deathbeds of orchards the boat dies down
And the bait is drowned among hayricks,

Land, land, land, nothing remains
Of the pacing, famous sea but its speech,
And into its talkative seven tombs
The anchor dives through the floors of a church.

Good-bye, good luck, struck the sun and the moon,
To the fisherman lost on the land.
He stands alone in the door of his home,
With his long-legged heart in his hand.",Ballad
13,Walt Whitman,"TO get betimes in Boston town, I rose this morning early;
   Here's a good place at the corner--I must stand and see the show.

   Clear the way there, Jonathan!
   Way for the President's marshal! Way for the government cannon!
   Way for the Federal foot and dragoons--and the apparitions copiously
         tumbling.

   I love to look on the stars and stripes--I hope the fifes will play
         Yankee Doodle.

   How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops!
   Every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston town.

   A fog follows--antiques of the same come limping,
   Some appear wooden-legged, and some appear bandaged and bloodless. 10

   Why this is indeed a show! It has called the dead out of the earth!
   The old grave-yards of the hills have hurried to see!
   Phantoms! phantoms countless by flank and rear!
   Cock'd hats of mothy mould! crutches made of mist!
   Arms in slings! old men leaning on young men's shoulders!

   What troubles you, Yankee phantoms? What is all this chattering of
         bare gums?
   Does the ague convulse your limbs? Do you mistake your crutches for
         fire-locks, and level them?

   If you blind your eyes with tears, you will not see the President's
         marshal;
   If you groan such groans, you might balk the government cannon.

   For shame, old maniacs! Bring down those toss'd arms, and let your
         white hair be;                                               20
   Here gape your great grand-sons--their wives gaze at them from the
         windows,
   See how well dress'd--see how orderly they conduct themselves.

   Worse and worse! Can't you stand it? Are you retreating?
   Is this hour with the living too dead for you?

   Retreat then! Pell-mell!
   To your graves! Back! back to the hills, old limpers!
   I do not think you belong here, anyhow.

   But there is one thing that belongs here--shall I tell you what it
         is, gentlemen of Boston?
   I will whisper it to the Mayor--he shall send a committee to England;
   They shall get a grant from the Parliament, go with a cart to the
         royal vault--haste!                                          30

   Dig out King George's coffin, unwrap him quick from the grave-
         clothes, box up his bones for a journey;
   Find a swift Yankee clipper--here is freight for you, black-bellied
         clipper,
   Up with your anchor! shake out your sails! steer straight toward
         Boston bay.

   Now call for the President's marshal again, bring out the government
         cannon,
   Fetch home the roarers from Congress, make another procession, guard
         it with foot and dragoons.

   This centre-piece for them:
   Look! all orderly citizens--look from the windows, women!

   The committee open the box, set up the regal ribs, glue those that
         will not stay,
   Clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the
         skull.

   You have got your revenge, old buster! The crown is come to its own,
         and more than its own.

   Stick your hands in your pockets, Jonathan--you are a made man from
         this day;                                                    40
   You are mighty cute--and here is one of your bargains.",Ballad
14,Rudyard Kipling,"If down here I chance to die,
  Solemnly I beg you take
All that is left of ""I""
  To the Hills for old sake's sake,
Pack me very thoroughly
  In the ice that used to slake
Pegs I drank when I was dry --
  This observe for old sake's sake.

To the railway station hie,
  There a single ticket take
For Umballa -- goods-train -- I
  Shall not mind delay or shake.
I shall rest contentedly
  Spite of clamor coolies make;
Thus in state and dignity
  Send me up for old sake's sake.

Next the sleepy Babu wake,
  Book a Kalka van ""for four.""
Few, I think, will care to make
  Journeys with me any more
As they used to do of yore.
  I shall need a ""special"" break --
Thing I never took before --
  Get me one for old sake's sake.

After that -- arrangements make.
  No hotel will take me in,
And a bullock's back would break
  'Neath the teak and leaden skin
Tonga ropes are frail and thin,
  Or, did I a back-seat take,
In a tonga I might spin, --
  Do your best for old sake's sake.

After that -- your work is done.
  Recollect a Padre must
Mourn the dear departed one --
  Throw the ashes and the dust.
Don't go down at once. I trust
  You will find excuse to ""snake
Three days' casual on the bust.""
  Get your fun for old sake's sake.

I could never stand the Plains.
  Think of blazing June and May
Think of those September rains
  Yearly till the Judgment Day!
I should never rest in peace,
  I should sweat and lie awake.
Rail me then, on my decease,
  To the Hills for old sake's sake.",Ballad
15,Sidney Lanier,"Into the woods my Master went,
Clean forspent, forspent.
Into the woods my Master came,
Forspent with love and shame.
But the olives they were not blind to Him,
The little gray leaves were kind to Him:
The thorn-tree had a mind to Him
When into the woods He came.

Out of the woods my Master went,
And He was well content.
Out of the woods my Master came,
Content with death and shame.
When Death and Shame would woo Him last,
From under the trees they drew Him last:
'Twas on a tree they slew Him -  last
When out of the woods He came.",Ballad
16,Ezra Pound,"For God, our God is a gallant foe 
That playeth behind the veil. 

I have loved my God as a child at heart 
That seeketh deep bosoms for rest, 
I have loved my God as a maid to man— 
But lo, this thing is best: 

To love your God as a gallant foe that plays behind the veil; 
To meet your God as the night winds meet beyond Arcturus' pale. 

I have played with God for a woman, 
I have staked with my God for truth, 
I have lost to my God as a man, clear-eyed— 
His dice be not of ruth. 

For I am made as a naked blade, 
But hear ye this thing in sooth: 

Who loseth to God as man to man 
Shall win at the turn of the game. 
I have drawn my blade where the lightnings meet 
But the ending is the same: 
Who loseth to God as the sword blades lose 
Shall win at the end of the game. 

For God, our God is a gallant foe that playeth behind the veil. 
Whom God deigns not to overthrow hath need of triple mail.",Ballad
17,Edna St. Vincent Millay,"""Son,"" said my mother,
When I was knee-high,
""you've need of clothes to cover you,
and not a rag have I.

""There's nothing in the house
To make a boy breeches,
Nor shears to cut a cloth with,
Nor thread to take stitches.

""There's nothing in the house
But a loaf-end of rye,
And a harp with a woman's head
Nobody will buy,""
And she began to cry.

That was in the early fall.
When came the late fall,
""Son,"" she said, ""the sight of you
Makes your mother's blood crawl,—

""Little skinny shoulder-blades
Sticking through your clothes!
And where you'll get a jacket from
God above knows.

""It's lucky for me, lad,
Your daddy's in the ground,
And can't see the way I let
His son go around!""
And she made a queer sound.

That was in the late fall.
When the winter came,
I'd not a pair of breeches
Nor a shirt to my name.

I couldn't go to school,
Or out of doors to play.
And all the other little boys
Passed our way.

""Son,"" said my mother,
""Come, climb into my lap,
And I'll chafe your little bones
While you take a nap.""

And, oh, but we were silly
For half and hour or more,
Me with my long legs,
Dragging on the floor,

A-rock-rock-rocking
To a mother-goose rhyme!
Oh, but we were happy
For half an hour's time!

But there was I, a great boy,
And what would folks say
To hear my mother singing me
To sleep all day,
In such a daft way?

Men say the winter
Was bad that year;
Fuel was scarce,
And food was dear.

A wind with a wolf's head
Howled about our door,
And we burned up the chairs
And sat upon the floor.

All that was left us
Was a chair we couldn't break,
And the harp with a woman's head
Nobody would take,
For song or pity's sake.

The night before Christmas
I cried with cold,
I cried myself to sleep 
Like a two-year old.

And in the deep night
I felt my mother rise,
And stare down upon me
With love in her eyes.

I saw my mother sitting
On the one good chair,
A light falling on her
From I couldn't tell where.

Looking nineteen,
And not a day older,
And the harp with a woman's head
Leaned against her shoulder.

Her thin fingers, moving
In the thin, tall strings,
Were weav-weav-weaving
Wonderful things.

Many bright threads,
From where I couldn't see,
Were running through the harp-strings
Rapidly,

And gold threads whistling
Through my mother's hand.
I saw the web grow,
And the pattern expand.

She wove a child's jacket,
And when it was done
She laid it on the floor
And wove another one.

She wove a red cloak
So regal to see,
""She's made it for a king's son,""
I said, ""and not for me.""
But I knew it was for me.

She wove a pair of breeches
Quicker than that!
She wove a pair of boots
And a little cocked hat.

She wove a pair of mittens,
Shw wove a little blouse,
She wove all night
In the still, cold house.

She sang as she worked,
And the harp-strings spoke;
Her voice never faltered,
And the thread never broke,
And when I awoke,—

There sat my mother
With the harp against her shoulder,
Looking nineteeen,
And not a day older, 

A smile about her lips,
And a light about her head,
And her hands in the harp-strings
Frozen dead.

And piled beside her
And toppling to the skies,
Were the clothes of a king's son,
Just my size.",Ballad
18,Ezra Pound,"Ha' we lost the goodliest fere o' all
For the priests and the gallows tree?
Aye lover he was of brawny men,
O' ships and the open sea.

When they came wi' a host to take Our Man
His smile was good to see,
""First let these go!"" quo' our Goodly Fere,
""Or I'll see ye damned,"" says he.

Aye he sent us out through the crossed high spears
And the scorn of his laugh rang free,
""Why took ye not me when I walked about
Alone in the town?"" says he.

Oh we drank his ""Hale"" in the good red wine
When we last made company,
No capon priest was the Goodly Fere
But a man o' men was he.

I ha' seen him drive a hundred men
Wi' a bundle o' cords swung free,
That they took the high and holy house
For their pawn and treasury.

They'll no' get him a' in a book I think
Though they write it cunningly;
No mouse of the scrolls was the Goodly Fere
But aye loved the open sea.

If they think they ha' snared our Goodly Fere
They are fools to the last degree.
""I'll go to the feast,"" quo' our Goodly Fere,
""Though I go to the gallows tree.""

""Ye ha' seen me heal the lame and blind,
And wake the dead,"" says he,
""Ye shall see one thing to master all:
'Tis how a brave man dies on the tree.""

A son of God was the Goodly Fere
That bade us his brothers be.
I ha' seen him cow a thousand men.
I have seen him upon the tree.

He cried no cry when they drave the nails
And the blood gushed hot and free,
The hounds of the crimson sky gave tongue
But never a cry cried he.

I ha' seen him cow a thousand men
On the hills o' Galilee,
They whined as he walked out calm between,
Wi' his eyes like the grey o' the sea,

Like the sea that brooks no voyaging
With the winds unleashed and free,
Like the sea that he cowed at Genseret
Wi' twey words spoke' suddently.

A master of men was the Goodly Fere,
A mate of the wind and sea,
If they think they ha' slain our Goodly Fere
They are fools eternally.

I ha' seen him eat o' the honey-comb
Sin' they nailed him to the tree.",Ballad
19,Thomas Lovell Beddoes,"WHEN we were girl and boy together,  
 We toss’d about the flowers  
 And wreath’d the blushing hours  
Into a posy green and sweet.  
 I sought the youngest, best, 
 And never was at rest  
Till I had laid them at thy fairy feet.  
But the days of childhood they were fleet,  
 And the blooming sweet-briar-breath’d weather,  
 When we were boy and girl together.
 
Then we were lad and lass together,  
 And sought the kiss of night  
 Before we felt aright,  
Sitting and singing soft and sweet.  
 The dearest thought of heart 
 With thee ’t was joy to part,  
And the greater half was thine, as meet.  
Still my eyelid’s dewy, my veins they beat  
 At the starry summer-evening weather,  
 When we were lad and lass together.
 
And we are man and wife together,  
 Although thy breast, once bold  
 With song, be clos’d and cold  
Beneath flowers’ roots and birds’ light feet.  
 Yet sit I by thy tomb,
 And dissipate the gloom  
With songs of loving faith and sorrow sweet.  
And fate and darkling grave kind dreams do cheat,  
 That, while fair life, young hope, despair and death are,  
 We ’re boy and girl, and lass and lad, and man and wife together.",Ballad
20,Edwin Arlington Robinson,"Slowly I smoke and hug my knee, 
The while a witless masquerade 
Of things that only children see 
Floats in a mist of light and shade: 
They pass, a flimsy cavalcade, 
And with a weak, remindful glow, 
The falling embers break and fade, 
As one by one the phantoms go. 

Then, with a melancholy glee 
To think where once my fancy strayed, 
I muse on what the years may be 
Whose coming tales are all unsaid, 
Till tongs and shovel, snugly laid 
Within their shadowed niches, grow 

By grim degrees to pick and spade, 
As one by one the phantoms go. 

But then, what though the mystic Three 
Around me ply their merry trade? -- 
And Charon soon may carry me 
Across the gloomy Stygian glade? -- 

Be up, my soul! nor be afraid 
Of what some unborn year may show; 
But mind your human debts are paid, 
As one by one the phantoms go.

This truth at least, good friend, we know; 
So live and laugh, nor be dismayed

21,François Villon,"So rough the goat will scratch, it cannot sleep.
So often goes the pot to the well that it breaks.
So long you heat iron, it will glow;
so heavily you hammer it, it shatters.
So good is the man as his praise;
so far he will go, and he's forgotten;
so bad he behaves, and he's despised.
So loud you cry Christmas, it comes.

So glib you talk, you end up in contradictions.
So good is your credit as the favors you got.
So much you promise that you will back out.
So doggedly you beg that your wish is granted;
so high climbs the price when you want a thing;
so much you want it that you pay the price;
so familiar it gets to you, you want it no more.
So loud you cry Christmas, it comes.

So, you love a dog.  Then feed it!
So long a song will run that people learn it.
So long you keep the fruit, it will rot.
So hot the struggle for a spot that it is won;
so cool you keep your act that your spirit freezes;
so hurriedly you act that you run into bad luck;
so tight you embrace that your catch slips away.
So loud you cry Christmas, it comes.

So you scoff and laugh, and the fun is gone.
So you crave and spend, and lose your shirt.
So candid you are, no blow can be too low.
So good as a gift should a promise be.
So, if you love God, you obey the Church.
So, when you give much, you borrow much.
So, shifting winds turn to storm.
So loud you cry Christmas, it comes.

Prince, so long as a fool persists, he grows wiser;
so, round the world he goes, but return he will,
so humbled and beaten back into servility.
So loud you cry Christmas, it is here.",Ballad
22,William Butler Yeats,"The old priest Peter Gilligan
Was weary night and day
For half his flock were in their beds
Or under green sods lay.

Once, while he nodded in a chair
At the moth-hour of the eve
Another poor man sent for him,
And he began to grieve.

'I have no rest, nor joy, nor peace,
For people die and die;
And after cried he, 'God forgive!
My body spake not I!'

He knelt, and leaning on the chair
He prayed and fell asleep;
And the moth-hour went from the fields,
And stars began to peep.

They slowly into millions grew,
And leaves shook in the wind
And God covered the world with shade
And whispered to mankind.

Upon the time of sparrow chirp
When the moths came once more,
The old priest Peter Gilligan
Stood upright on the floor.

'Mavrone, mavrone! The man has died
While I slept in the chair.'
He roused his horse out of its sleep
And rode with little care.

He rode now as he never rode,
By rocky lane and fen;
The sick man's wife opened the door,
'Father! you come again!'

'And is the poor man dead?' he cried
'He died an hour ago.'
The old priest Peter Gilligan
In grief swayed to and fro.

'When you were gone, he turned and died,
As merry as a bird.'
The old priest Peter Gilligan
He knelt him at that word.

'He Who hath made the night of stars
For souls who tire and bleed,
Sent one of this great angels down,
To help me in my need.

'He Who is wrapped in purple robes,
With planets in His care
Had pity on the least of things
Asleep upon a chair.'",Ballad
23,Francis Duggan,"I have walked through tougher Harlem where few strangers dare to go
And I've been in London City in the rain and in the snow
And I've worked in inner Melbourne in the searing summer heat
And believe me if I tell you I have earned the bread I eat.

I have laboured in deep trenches with my life I've took a dare
And I've worked in cherry pickers ninety foot up in the air
And the hands of time keep turning and the years go quickly by
And the man who lives on welfare is still better off than I.

And who needs the tag of good worker it's no big deal anyway
He's a wiser and better off man who sits at home all day
And his conscience doesn't prick him isn't he the lucky one
And must I be one great idiot to go labouring in the sun.

I was low in social ladder and I still am way down low
And I feel my life's been wasted for my years have nought to show
Some may say he's a good worker that's of little use to me
All I need is lots of money I don't need your sympathy.

I felt happy for a brief while in a green Land miles away
In that beautiful green Country where I lived for many a day
I felt inwardly contented even though I was quite poor
Listening to the pipits piping in the meads of Annagloor.

Till the wanderlust possessed me I grew restless as the wind
Pity on all migrant workers, pity on all wandering kind
Went to live in foreign city worked with strong hard working men
But I've nought to show for labour I'm poor now as I was then.

In Ireland I cut down pine trees in the hills where bracken grow
And in Wales I picked potatoes many, many years ago
I have laboured for a living on myself I have been cruel
All the World laughs at an idiot all the World laughs at a fool.

I am getting old and weary and what hair I've left is gray
And I'm well beyond the fifty and I've seen a better day
And like the work weary work horse all the better years are gone
And I still work as a labourer and I still keep plodding on.

Please don't say he's a good worker such words I don't wish to hear
For I've nought to show for labour though I've worked for many a year
Words like 'good hard working fellow' does not do a thing for me

A lion met America
in the road
they stared at each other
two figures on the crossroads in the desert.

America screamed
The lion roared
They leaped at each other
America desperate to win
Fighting with bombs, flamethrowers,
knives forks submarines.

All our prayers and prying -- 
All our tears and sighing, 
Sorrow, change, and woe -- 
All our where-and-whying 
For friends that come and go. 

Life awakes and burns, 
Age and death defying, 
Till at last it learns 
All but Love is dying; 
Love's the trade we're plying, 
God has willed it so; 
Shrouds are what we're buying 
For friends that come and go. 

Man forever yearns 
For the thing that's flying.

Dust that wanders, eying

26,Banjo Paterson,"The railway rattled and roared and swung 
With jolting and bumping trucks. 
The sun, like a billiard red ball, hung 
In the Western sky: and the tireless tongue 
Of the wild-eyed man in the corner told 
This terrible tale of the days of old, 
And the party that ought to have kept the ducks. 
""Well, it ain't all joy bein' on the land 
With an overdraft that'd knock you flat; 
And the rabbits have pretty well took command; 
But the hardest thing for a man to stand 
Is the feller who says 'Well I told you so! 
You should ha' done this way, don't you know!' -- 
I could lay a bait for a man like that. 

""The grasshoppers struck us in ninety-one 
And what they leave -- well, it ain't de luxe. 
But a growlin' fault-findin' son of a gun 
Who'd lent some money to stock our run -- 
I said they'd eaten what grass we had -- 
Says he, 'Your management's very bad; 
You had a right to have kept some ducks!' 

""To have kept some ducks! And the place was white! 
Wherever you went you had to tread 
On grasshoppers guzzlin' day and night; 
And then with a swoosh they rose in flight, 
If you didn't look out for yourself they'd fly 
Like bullets into your open eye 
And knock it out of the back of your head. 

""There isn't a turkey or goose or swan, 
Or a duck that quacks, or a hen that clucks, 
Can make a difference on a run 
When a grasshopper plague has once begun; 
'If you'd finance us,' I says, 'I'd buy 
Ten thousand emus and have a try; 
The job,' I says, 'is too big for ducks! 

""'You must fetch a duck when you come to stay; 
A great big duck -- a Muscovy toff -- 
Ready and fit,' I says, 'for the fray; 
And if the grasshoppers come our way 
You turn your duck into the lucerne patch, 
And I'd be ready to make a match 
That the grasshoppers eat his feathers off!"" 

""He came to visit us by and by, 
And it just so happened one day in spring 
A kind of cloud came over the sky -- 
A wall of grasshoppers nine miles high, 
And nine miles thick, and nine hundred wide, 
Flyin' in regiments, side by side, 
And eatin' up every living thing. 

""All day long, like a shower of rain, 
You'd hear 'em smackin' against the wall, 
Tap, tap, tap, on the window pane, 
And they'd rise and jump at the house again 
Till their crippled carcasses piled outside. 
But what did it matter if thousands died -- 
A million wouldn't be missed at all. 

""We were drinkin' grasshoppers -- so to speak -- 
Till we skimmed their carcasses off the spring; 
And they fell so thick in the station creek 
They choked the waterholes all the week. 
There was scarcely room for a trout to rise, 
And they'd only take artificial flies -- 
They got so sick of the real thing. 

""An Arctic snowstorm was beat to rags 
When the hoppers rose for their morning flight 
With the flapping noise like a million flags: 
And the kitchen chimney was stuffed with bags 
For they'd fall right into the fire, and fry 
Till the cook sat down and began to cry -- 
And never a duck or fowl in sight. 

""We strolled across to the railroad track -- 
Under a cover beneath some trucks, 
I sees a feather and hears a quack; 
I stoops and I pulls the tarpaulin back -- 
Every duck in the place was there, 
No good to them was the open air.

For she feeds mulberries to silkworms.
She gets them by the south wall of the town.
With green strings she makes the warp of her basket,
She makes the shoulder-straps of her basket
from the boughs of Katsura,
And she piles her hair up on the left side of her headpiece.

Her earrings are made of pearl,
Her underskirt is of green pattern-silk,
Her overskirt is the same silk dyed in purple,
And when men going by look on Rafu
They set down their burdens,
They stand and twirl their moustaches.",Ballad
30,Alfred Lord Tennyson,"I

AT Flores, in the Azores Sir Richard Grenville lay,  
And a pinnace, like a flutter’d bird, came flying from far away;  
“Spanish ships of war at sea! we have sighted fifty-three!”  
Then sware Lord Thomas Howard: “’Fore God I am no coward;  
But I cannot meet them here, for my ships are out of gear,          
And the half my men are sick. I must fly, but follow quick.  
We are six ships of the line; can we fight with fifty-three?”  
 
II

Then spake Sir Richard Grenville: “I know you are no coward;  
You fly them for a moment to fight with them again.  
But I’ve ninety men and more that are lying sick ashore.         
I should count myself the coward if I left them, my Lord Howard,  
To these Inquisition dogs and the devildoms of Spain.”  
 
III

So Lord Howard past away with five ships of war that day,  
Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven;  
But Sir Richard bore in hand all his sick men from the land         
Very carefully and slow,  
Men of Bideford in Devon,  
And we laid them on the ballast down below:  
For we brought them all aboard,  
And they blest him in their pain, that they were not left to Spain,         
To the thumb-screw and the stake, for the glory of the Lord.  
 
IV

He had only a hundred seamen to work the ship and to fight,  
And he sailed away from Flores till the Spaniard came in sight,  
With his huge sea-castles heaving upon the weather bow.  
“Shall we fight or shall we fly?         
Good Sir Richard, tell us now,  
For to fight is but to die!  
There’ll be little of us left by the time this sun be set.”  
And Sir Richard said again: “We be all good Englishmen.  
Let us bang these dogs of Seville, the children of the devil,         
For I never turn’d my back upon Don or devil yet.”  
 
V

Sir Richard spoke and he laugh’d, and we roar’d a hurrah and so  
The little Revenge ran on sheer into the heart of the foe,  
With her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below;  
For half of their fleet to the right and half to the left were seen,         
And the little Revenge ran on thro’ the long sea-lane between.  
 
VI

Thousands of their soldiers look’d down from their decks and laugh’d,  
Thousands of their seamen made mock at the mad little craft  
Running on and on, till delay’d  
By their mountain-like San Philip that, of fifteen hundred tons,        
And up-shadowing high above us with her yawning tiers of guns,  
Took the breath from our sails, and we stay’d.  
 
VII

And while now the great San Philip hung above us like a cloud  
Whence the thunderbolt will fall  
Long and loud,         45 
Four galleons drew away  
From the Spanish fleet that day.  
And two upon the larboard and two upon the starboard lay,  
And the battle-thunder broke from them all.  
 
VIII

But anon the great San Philip, she bethought herself and went,         
Having that within her womb that had left her ill content;  
And the rest they came aboard us, and they fought us hand to hand,  
For a dozen times they came with their pikes and musqueteers,  
And a dozen times we shook ’em off as a dog that shakes his ears  
When he leaps from the water to the land.           
IX

And the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer sea,  
But never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three.  
Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came,  
Ship after ship, the whole night long, with her battle-thunder and flame;  
Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and her shame.         
For some were sunk and many were shatter’d and so could fight us no more—  
God of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before?  
 
X

For he said, “Fight on! fight on!”  
Tho’ his vessel was all but a wreck;  
And it chanced that, when half of the short summer night was gone,         
With a grisly wound to be drest he had left the deck,  
But a bullet struck him that was dressing it suddenly dead,  
And himself he was wounded again in the side and the head,  
And he said, “Fight on! fight on!”  
 
XI

And the night went down, and the sun smiled out far over the summer sea,        
And the Spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring;  
But they dared not touch us again, for they fear’d that we still could sting,  
So they watch’d what the end would be.  
And we had not fought them in vain,  
But in perilous plight were we,         
Seeing forty of our poor hundred were slain,  
And half of the rest of us maim’d for life  
In the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife;  
And the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and cold,  
And the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was all of it spent;
And the masts and the rigging were lying over the side;  
But Sir Richard cried in his English pride:  
“We have fought such a fight for a day and a night  
As may never be fought again!  
We have won great glory, my men!         
And a day less or more  
At sea or ashore,  
We die—does it matter when?  
Sink me the ship, Master Gunner—sink her, split her in twain!  
Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!”           
XII

And the gunner said, “Ay, ay,” but the seamen made reply:  
“We have children, we have wives,  
And the Lord hath spared our lives.  
We will make the Spaniard promise, if we yield, to let us go;  
We shall live to fight again and to strike another blow.”         
And the lion there lay dying, and they yielded to the foe.  
 
XIII

And the stately Spanish men to their flagship bore him then,  
Where they laid him by the mast, old Sir Richard caught at last,  
And they praised him to his face with their courtly foreign grace;  
But he rose upon their decks, and he cried:         
“I have fought for Queen and Faith like a valiant man and true;  
I have only done my duty as a man is bound to do.  
With a joyful spirit I Sir Richard Grenville die!”  
And he fell upon their decks, and he died.  
 
XIV

And they stared at the dead that had been so valiant and true,         
And had holden the power and glory of Spain so cheap  
That he dared her with one little ship and his English few;  
Was he devil or man? He was devil for aught they knew,  
But they sank his body with honor down into the deep.  
And they mann’d the Revenge with a swarthier alien crew,         
And away she sail’d with her loss and long’d for her own;  
When a wind from the lands they had ruin’d awoke from sleep,  
And the water began to heave and the weather to moan,  
And or ever that evening ended a great gale blew,  
And a wave like the wave that is raised by an earthquake grew,         
Till it smote on their hulls and their sails and their masts and their flags,  
And the whole sea plunged and fell on the shot-shatter’d navy of Spain,  
And the little Revenge herself went down by the island crags  
To be lost evermore in the main.",Ballad

What is peeping from your wings, oh mother hen?

Yea, but it is cruel when undressed is all the blossom,
And her shift is lying white upon the floor,

Creeps upon her then and gathers in his store.

Oh the golden sparkles laid extinct!

A land of ruin, far away; 
Around me hung on every hand 
A deathful stillness of decay; 
And silent, as in bleak dismay 
That song should thus forsaken be, 
On that forgotten ground there lay 
The broken flutes of Arcady. 

The forest that was all so grand 
When pipes and tabors had their sway 
Stood leafless now, a ghostly band 
Of skeletons in cold array. 
A lonely surge of ancient spray 
Told of an unforgetful sea, 
But iron blows had hushed for aye 
The broken flutes of Arcady. 

No more by summer breezes fanned, 
The place was desolate and gray; 
But still my dream was to command 
New life into that shrunken clay. 
I tried it. Yes, you scan to-day, 
With uncommiserating glee, 
The songs of one who strove to play 
The broken flutes of Arcady.

The dim White Ship like a white bird lay; 
Laughing at life and the world they sought her, 
And out she swung to the silvering bay.

Up from the flood where the faint stars play, 
And the bones of the brave in the wave are lying.

Nor ever they knew of a ghoul's eye spying 
Their splendor a flickering phantom to stray 
Where the bones of the brave in the wave are lying. 

Through the mist of a drunken dream they brought her 
(This wild white bird) for the sea-fiend's prey: 
The pitiless reef in his hard clutch caught her, 
And hurled her down where the dead men stay. 
A torturing silence of wan dismay -- 
Shrieks and curses of mad souls dying -- 
Then down they sank to slumber and sway 
Where the bones of the brave in the wave are lying.

And they hae sworn a solemn oath

But the cheerful Spring came kindly on, 
And show'rs began to fall; 
John Barleycorn got up again,

And he grew thick and strong; 
His head weel arm'd wi' pointed spears,

But sweeter far as wise men know
Spring from the woodland vine.

No need for bowl or silver spoon,
Sugar or spice or cream,
Has the wild berry plucked in June
Beside the trickling stream.

One such to melt at the tongue's root,
Confounding taste with scent,
Beats a full peck of garden fruit:
Which points my argument.

May sudden justice overtake
And snap the froward pen,
That old and palsied poets shake
Against the minds of men;

Blasphemers trusting to hold caught
In far-flung webs of ink
The utmost ends of human thought,
Till nothing's left to think.

But may the gift of heavenly peace
And glory for all time
Keep the boy Tom who tending geese
First made the nursery rhyme.

By the brookside one August day,
Using the sun for clock,
Tom whiled the languid hours away
Beside his scattering flock,

Carving with a sharp pointed stone
On a broad slab of slate
The famous lives of Jumping Joan,
Dan Fox and Greedy Kate;

Rhyming of wolves and bears and birds,
Spain, Scotland, Babylon,
That sister Kate might learn the words
To tell to Toddling John.

But Kate, who could not stay content
To learn her lesson pat,
New beauty to the rough lines lent
By changing this or that;

And she herself set fresh things down
In corners of her slate,
Of lambs and lanes and London Town.
God's blessing fall on Kate!

The baby loved the simple sound,
With jolly glee he shook,
And soon the lines grew smooth and round
Like pebbles in Tom's brook,

From mouth to mouth told and retold
By children sprawled at ease
Before the fire in winter's cold,
In June beneath tall trees;

Till though long lost are stone and slate,
Though the brook no more runs,
And dead long time are Tom, John, Kate,
Their sons and their sons' sons;

Yet, as when Time with stealthy tread
Lays the rich garden waste,
The woodland berry ripe and red
Fails not in scent or taste,

So these same rhymes shall still be told
To children yet unborn,
While false philosophy growing old
Fades and is killed by scorn.",Ballad
36,Geoffrey Chaucer,"Sometime this world was so steadfast and stable,
That man's word was held obligation;
And now it is so false and deceivable,
That word and work, as in conclusion,
Be nothing one; for turned up so down
Is all this world, through meed and wilfulness,
That all is lost for lack of steadfastness.

What makes this world to be so variable,
But lust that folk have in dissension?
For now-a-days a man is held unable
But if he can, by some collusion,
Do his neighbour wrong or oppression.
What causeth this but wilful wretchedness,
That all is lost for lack of steadfastness?

Truth is put down, reason is holden fable;
Virtue hath now no domination;
Pity exil'd, no wight is merciable;
Through covetise is blent discretion;
The worlde hath made permutation
From right to wrong, from truth to fickleness,
That all is lost for lack of steadfastness.

L'Envoy.

O Prince! desire to be honourable;
Cherish thy folk, and hate extortion;
Suffer nothing that may be reprovable
To thine estate, done in thy region;
Show forth the sword of castigation;
Dread God, do law, love thorough worthiness,
And wed thy folk again to steadfastness.",Ballad
37,Yevgeny Yevtushenko,"We had slaughtered a hundred white whales, 
civilization was quite forgotten, 
our lungs were burned out from smoking shag, 
but on sighting port we blew out our chests like barrels
and began to speak to one another politely, 
and with the noble goal of drinking
we went ashore from the schooner at Amderma.

In Amderma we walked like gods, 
swaggering along with our hands on our hips, 
and through the port our beards and sidewhiskers
kept their bearings on the pub, 
and passing girls and shellbacks
as well as all the local dogs
went along with us as escort.

But, clouding the whole planet, 
a notice hung in the shop: 'No Spirits! '
We looked at some sparkling wine from the Don
as if it were feeble fruit juice, 
and through our agonized yearning
we realized-it wouldn't work.

Now who could have drunk our spirits, our vodka? 
It's dreadful the way people drink-simply ruinous.
But skinny as a skeleton, Petka Markovsky from Odessa, 
as it always happens with him, 
suddenly disappeared somewhere
giving a secretive 'Sh-sshh! '

And shortly afterward, with much clinking, 
he turned up with a huge cardboard box, 
already slightly merry, 
and it was a sweet clinking the box made
as we woke up to the fact: 'There she is! She's apples! '
and Markovsky gave us the wink: 'She's right! '

We made a splash, waving to everyone-
Chartered a deluxe room in the hotel
and sat down as we were on the bed.
Cords flew off the box
and there, in the glittering columns of the bottles, 
bulging, stern, cosy, 
absolutely hygienic-
triple-distilled eau de cologne stood before us! 

And Markovsky rose, lifting his glass, 
pulled down his seaman's jacket, 
and began: 'I'd like to say something...'
'Then say it! ' everyone began to shout.
But before anything else
they wanted to wet their whistles.

Markovsky said: 'Come on-let's have a swig! 
The doctor told me eau de cologne
is the best thing to keep the wrinkles away.
Let them judge us! -We don't give a damn! 
We used to drink all sorts of wine! 
When we were in Germany
we filled the radiators of our tanks
with wine from the Mosel.

We don't need consumer goods! 
We need the wind, the sky! 
Old mates, listen to this
in our souls, as though in the safe deposit: 
We have the sea, our mothers and young brothers-
All the rest...is rubbish! '

Bestriding the earth like a giant, 
Markovsky stood with a glass in his hand
that held the foaming seas.
The skipper observed: 'Everything is shipshape! '
and only the boatswain sobbed like a child: 
'But my mother is dead...'

And we all began to burst into tears, 
quite easily, quite shamelessly, 
as if in the midst of our own families, 
mourning with bitter tears
at first for the boatswain's mother, 
and afterward simply for ourselves.

Already a rueful notice hung in the chemist's shop-
'No Triple Eau de Cologne'-
but eight of us sea wolves
sobbed over almost all of Russia! 
And in our sobs we reeked
like eight barbershops.

Tears, like squalls, 
swept away heaps of false values, 
of puffed-up names, 
and quietly remaining inside us
was only the sea, our mothers and young brothers-
even the mother who was dead...

I wept as though I was being set free, 
I wept as if I was being born anew, 
a different person from what I'd been, 
and before God and before myself, 
like the tears of those drunken whalemen, 
my soul was pure.",Ballad
38,Oscar Wilde,"Version II

He did not wear his scarlet coat, 
For blood and wine are red, 
And blood and wine were on his hands 
When they found him with the dead, 
The poor dead woman whom he loved, 
And murdered in her bed. 


He walked amongst the Trial Men 
In a suit of shabby gray; 
A cricket cap was on his head, 
And his step seemed light and gay; 
But I never saw a man who looked 
So wistfully at the day. 


I never saw a man who looked 
With such a wistful eye 
Upon that little tent of blue 
Which prisoners call the sky, 
And at every drifting cloud that went 
With sails of silver by. 


I walked, with other souls in pain, 
Within another ring, 
And was wondering if the man had done 
A great or little thing, 
When a voice behind me whispered low, 
'That fellow's got to swing.' 


Dear Christ! the very prison walls 
Suddenly seemed to reel, 
And the sky above my head became 
Like a casque of scorching steel; 
And, though I was a soul in pain, 
My pain I could not feel. 


I only knew what haunted thought 
Quickened his step, and why 
He looked upon the garish day 
With such a wistful eye; 
The man had killed the thing he loved, 
And so he had to die. 


Yet each man kills the thing he loves, 
By each let this be heard, 
Some do it with a bitter look, 
Some with a flattering word, 
The coward does it with a kiss, 
The brave man with a sword! 


Some kill their love when they are young, 
And some when they are old; 
Some strangle with the hands of Lust, 
Some with the hands of Gold: 
The kindest use a knife, because 
The dead so soon grow cold. 


Some love too little, some too long, 
Some sell, and others buy; 
Some do the deed with many tears, 
And some without a sigh: 
For each man kills the thing he loves, 
Yet each man does not die. 


He does not die a death of shame 
On a day of dark disgrace, 
Nor have a noose about his neck, 
Nor a cloth upon his face, 
Nor drop feet foremost through the floor 
Into an empty space. 


He does not sit with silent men 
Who watch him night and day; 
Who watch him when he tries to weep, 
And when he tries to pray; 
Who watch him lest himself should rob 
The prison of its prey. 


He does not wake at dawn to see 
Dread figures throng his room, 
The shivering Chaplain robed in white, 
The Sheriff stern with gloom, 
And the Governor all in shiny black, 
With the yellow face of Doom. 


He does not rise in piteous haste 
To put on convict-clothes, 
While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes 
Each new and nerve-twitched pose, 
Fingering a watch whose little ticks 
Are like horrible hammer-blows. 


He does not feel that sickening thirst 
That sands one's throat, before 
The hangman with his gardener's gloves 
Comes through the padded door, 
And binds one with three leathern thongs, 
That the throat may thirst no more. 


He does not bend his head to hear 
The Burial Office read, 
Nor, while the anguish of his soul 
Tells him he is not dead, 
Cross his own coffin, as he moves 
Into the hideous shed. 


He does not stare upon the air 
Through a little roof of glass: 
He does not pray with lips of clay 
For his agony to pass; 
Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek 
The kiss of Caiaphas. 


II

Six weeks the guardsman walked the yard, 
In the suit of shabby gray: 
His cricket cap was on his head, 
And his step was light and gay, 
But I never saw a man who looked 
So wistfully at the day. 


I never saw a man who looked 
With such a wistful eye 
Upon that little tent of blue 
Which prisoners call the sky, 
And at every wandering cloud that trailed 
Its ravelled fleeces by. 


He did not wring his hands, as do 
Those witless men who dare 
To try to rear the changeling Hope 
In the cave of black Despair: 
He only looked upon the sun, 
And drank the morning air. 


He did not wring his hands nor weep, 
Nor did he peek or pine, 
But he drank the air as though it held 
Some healthful anodyne; 
With open mouth he drank the sun 
As though it had been wine! 


And I and all the souls in pain, 
Who tramped the other ring, 
Forgot if we ourselves had done 
A great or little thing, 
And watched with gaze of dull amaze 
The man who had to swing. 


For strange it was to see him pass 
With a step so light and gay, 
And strange it was to see him look 
So wistfully at the day, 
And strange it was to think that he 
Had such a debt to pay. 


The oak and elm have pleasant leaves 
That in the spring-time shoot: 
But grim to see is the gallows-tree, 
With its alder-bitten root, 
And, green or dry, a man must die 
Before it bears its fruit! 


The loftiest place is the seat of grace 
For which all worldlings try: 
But who would stand in hempen band 
Upon a scaffold high, 
And through a murderer's collar take 
His last look at the sky? 


It is sweet to dance to violins 
When Love and Life are fair: 
To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes 
Is delicate and rare: 
But it is not sweet with nimble feet 
To dance upon the air! 


So with curious eyes and sick surmise 
We watched him day by day, 
And wondered if each one of us 
Would end the self-same way, 
For none can tell to what red Hell 
His sightless soul may stray. 


At last the dead man walked no more 
Amongst the Trial Men, 
And I knew that he was standing up 
In the black dock's dreadful pen, 
And that never would I see his face 
For weal or woe again. 


Like two doomed ships that pass in storm 
We had crossed each other's way: 
But we made no sign, we said no word, 
We had no word to say; 
For we did not meet in the holy night, 
But in the shameful day. 


A prison wall was round us both, 
Two outcast men we were: 
The world had thrust us from its heart, 
And God from out His care: 
And the iron gin that waits for Sin 
Had caught us in its snare. 


III

In Debtors' Yard the stones are hard, 
And the dripping wall is high, 
So it was there he took the air 
Beneath the leaden sky, 
And by each side a warder walked, 
For fear the man might die. 


Or else he sat with those who watched 
His anguish night and day; 
Who watched him when he rose to weep, 
And when he crouched to pray; 
Who watched him lest himself should rob 
Their scaffold of its prey. 


The Governor was strong upon 
The Regulations Act: 
The Doctor said that Death was but 
A scientific fact: 
And twice a day the Chaplain called, 
And left a little tract. 


And twice a day he smoked his pipe, 
And drank his quart of beer: 
His soul was resolute, and held 
No hiding-place for fear; 
He often said that he was glad 
The hangman's day was near. 


But why he said so strange a thing 
No warder dared to ask: 
For he to whom a watcher's doom 
Is given as his task, 
Must set a lock upon his lips, 
And make his face a mask. 


Or else he might be moved, and try 
To comfort or console: 
And what should Human Pity do 
Pent up in Murderers' Hole? 
What word of grace in such a place 
Could help a brother's soul? 


With slouch and swing around the ring 
We trod the Fools' Parade! 
We did not care: we knew we were 
The Devils' Own Brigade: 
And shaven head and feet of lead 
Make a merry masquerade. 


We tore the tarry rope to shreds 
With blunt and bleeding nails; 
We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors, 
And cleaned the shining rails: 
And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank, 
And clattered with the pails. 


We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones, 
We turned the dusty drill: 
We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns, 
And sweated on the mill: 
But in the heart of every man 
Terror was lying still. 


So still it lay that every day 
Crawled like a weed-clogged wave: 
And we forgot the bitter lot 
That waits for fool and knave, 
Till once, as we tramped in from work, 
We passed an open grave. 


With yawning mouth the horrid hole 
Gaped for a living thing; 
The very mud cried out for blood 
To the thirsty asphalte ring: 
And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair 
The fellow had to swing. 


Right in we went, with soul intent 
On Death and Dread and Doom: 
The hangman, with his little bag, 
Went shuffling through the gloom: 
And I trembled as I groped my way 
Into my numbered tomb. 


That night the empty corridors 
Were full of forms of Fear, 
And up and down the iron town 
Stole feet we could not hear, 
And through the bars that hide the stars 
White faces seemed to peer. 


He lay as one who lies and dreams 
In a pleasant meadow-land, 
The watchers watched him as he slept, 
And could not understand 
How one could sleep so sweet a sleep 
With a hangman close at hand. 


But there is no sleep when men must weep 
Who never yet have wept: 
So we- the fool, the fraud, the knave- 
That endless vigil kept, 
And through each brain on hands of pain 
Another's terror crept. 


Alas! it is a fearful thing 
To feel another's guilt! 
For, right within, the sword of Sin 
Pierced to its poisoned hilt, 
And as molten lead were the tears we shed 
For the blood we had not spilt. 


The warders with their shoes of felt 
Crept by each padlocked door, 
And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe, 
Gray figures on the floor, 
And wondered why men knelt to pray 
Who never prayed before. 


All through the night we knelt and prayed, 
Mad mourners of a corse! 
The troubled plumes of midnight shook 
Like the plumes upon a hearse: 
And as bitter wine upon a sponge 
Was the savour of Remorse. 


The gray cock crew, the red cock crew, 
But never came the day: 
And crooked shapes of Terror crouched, 
In the corners where we lay: 
And each evil sprite that walks by night 
Before us seemed to play. 


They glided past, the glided fast, 
Like travellers through a mist: 
They mocked the moon in a rigadoon 
Of delicate turn and twist, 
And with formal pace and loathsome grace 
The phantoms kept their tryst. 


With mop and mow, we saw them go, 
Slim shadows hand in hand: 
About, about, in ghostly rout 
They trod a saraband: 
And the damned grotesques made arabesques, 
Like the wind upon the sand! 


With the pirouettes of marionettes, 
They tripped on pointed tread: 
But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear, 
As their grisly masque they led, 
And loud they sang, and long they sang, 
For they sang to wake the dead. 


'Oho! ' they cried, 'the world is wide, 
But fettered limbs go lame! 
And once, or twice, to throw the dice 
Is a gentlemanly game, 
But he does not win who plays with Sin 
In the secret House of Shame.' 


No things of air these antics were, 
That frolicked with such glee: 
To men whose lives were held in gyves, 
And whose feet might not go free, 
Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things, 
Most terrible to see. 


Around, around, they waltzed and wound; 
Some wheeled in smirking pairs; 
With the mincing step of a demirep 
Some sidled up the stairs: 
And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer, 
Each helped us at our prayers. 


The morning wind began to moan, 
But still the night went on: 
Through its giant loom the web of gloom 
Crept till each thread was spun: 
And, as we prayed, we grew afraid 
Of the Justice of the Sun. 


The moaning wind went wandering round 
The weeping prison wall: 
Till like a wheel of turning steel 
We felt the minutes crawl: 
O moaning wind! what had we done 
To have such a seneschal? 


At last I saw the shadowed bars, 
Like a lattice wrought in lead, 
Move right across the whitewashed wall 
That faced my three-plank bed, 
And I knew that somewhere in the world 
God's dreadful dawn was red. 


At six o'clock we cleaned our cells, 
At seven all was still, 
But the sough and swing of a mighty wing 
The prison seemed to fill, 
For the Lord of Death with icy breath 
Had entered in to kill. 


He did not pass in purple pomp, 
Nor ride a moon-white steed. 
Three yards of cord and a sliding board 
Are all the gallows' need: 
So with rope of shame the Herald came 
To do the secret deed. 


We were as men who through a fen 
Of filthy darkness grope: 
We did not dare to breathe a prayer, 
Or to give our anguish scope: 
Something was dead in each of us, 
And what was dead was Hope. 


For Man's grim Justice goes its way 
And will not swerve aside: 
It slays the weak, it slays the strong, 
It has a deadly stride: 
With iron heel it slays the strong 
The monstrous parricide! 


We waited for the stroke of eight: 
Each tongue was thick with thirst: 
For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate 
That makes a man accursed, 
And Fate will use a running noose 
For the best man and the worst. 


We had no other thing to do, 
Save to wait for the sign to come: 
So, like things of stone in a valley lone, 
Quiet we sat and dumb: 
But each man's heart beat thick and quick, 
Like a madman on a drum! 


With sudden shock the prison-clock 
Smote on the shivering air, 
And from all the gaol rose up a wail 
Of impotent despair, 
Like the sound the frightened marshes hear 
From some leper in his lair. 


And as one sees most fearful things 
In the crystal of a dream, 
We saw the greasy hempen rope 
Hooked to the blackened beam, 
And heard the prayer the hangman's snare 
Strangled into a scream. 


And all the woe that moved him so 
That he gave that bitter cry, 
And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats, 
None knew so well as I: 
For he who lives more lives than one 
More deaths that one must die. 


IV

There is no chapel on the day 
On which they hang a man: 
The Chaplain's heart is far too sick, 
Or his face is far too wan, 
Or there is that written in his eyes 
Which none should look upon. 


So they kept us close till nigh on noon, 
And then they rang the bell, 
And the warders with their jingling keys 
Opened each listening cell, 
And down the iron stair we tramped, 
Each from his separate Hell. 


Out into God's sweet air we went, 
But not in wonted way, 
For this man's face was white with fear, 
And that man's face was gray, 
And I never saw sad men who looked 
So wistfully at the day. 


I never saw sad men who looked 
With such a wistful eye 
Upon that little tent of blue 
We prisoners called the sky, 
And at every happy cloud that passed 
In such strange freedom by. 


But there were those amongst us all 
Who walked with downcast head, 
And knew that, had each got his due, 
They should have died instead: 
He had but killed a thing that lived, 
Whilst they had killed the dead. 


For he who sins a second time 
Wakes a dead soul to pain, 
And draws it from its spotted shroud 
And makes it bleed again, 
And makes it bleed great gouts of blood, 
And makes it bleed in vain! 


Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb 
With crooked arrows starred, 
Silently we went round and round 
The slippery asphalte yard; 
Silently we went round and round, 
And no man spoke a word. 


Silently we went round and round, 
And through each hollow mind 
The Memory of dreadful things 
Rushed like a dreadful wind, 
And Horror stalked before each man, 
And Terror crept behind. 


The warders strutted up and down, 
And watched their herd of brutes, 
Their uniforms were spick and span, 
And they wore their Sunday suits, 
But we knew the work they had been at, 
By the quicklime on their boots. 


For where a grave had opened wide, 
There was no grave at all: 
Only a stretch of mud and sand 
By the hideous prison-wall, 
And a little heap of burning lime, 
That the man should have his pall. 


For he has a pall, this wretched man, 
Such as few men can claim: 
Deep down below a prison-yard, 
Naked, for greater shame, 
He lies, with fetters on each foot, 
Wrapt in a sheet of flame! 


And all the while the burning lime 
Eats flesh and bone away, 
It eats the brittle bones by night, 
And the soft flesh by day, 
It eats the flesh and bone by turns, 
But it eats the heart alway. 


For three long years they will not sow 
Or root or seedling there: 
For three long years the unblessed spot 
Will sterile be and bare, 
And look upon the wondering sky 
With unreproachful stare. 


They think a murderer's heart would taint 
Each simple seed they sow. 
It is not true! God's kindly earth 
Is kindlier than men know, 
And the red rose would but glow more red, 
The white rose whiter blow. 


Out of his mouth a red, red rose! 
Out of his heart a white! 
For who can say by what strange way, 
Christ brings His will to light, 
Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore 
Bloomed in the great Pope's sight? 


But neither milk-white rose nor red 
May bloom in prison air; 
The shard, the pebble, and the flint, 
Are what they give us there: 
For flowers have been known to heal 
A common man's despair. 


So never will wine-red rose or white, 
Petal by petal, fall 
On that stretch of mud and sand that lies 
By the hideous prison-wall, 
To tell the men who tramp the yard 
That God's Son died for all. 


Yet though the hideous prison-wall 
Still hems him round and round, 
And a spirit may not walk by night 
That is with fetters bound, 
And a spirit may but weep that lies 
In such unholy ground, 


He is at peace- this wretched man- 
At peace, or will be soon: 
There is no thing to make him mad, 
Nor does Terror walk at noon, 
For the lampless Earth in which he lies 
Has neither Sun nor Moon. 


They hanged him as a beast is hanged: 
They did not even toll 
A requiem that might have brought 
Rest to his startled soul, 
But hurriedly they took him out, 
And hid him in a hole. 


The warders stripped him of his clothes, 
And gave him to the flies: 
They mocked the swollen purple throat, 
And the stark and staring eyes: 
And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud 
In which the convict lies. 


The Chaplain would not kneel to pray 
By his dishonoured grave: 
Nor mark it with that blessed Cross 
That Christ for sinners gave, 
Because the man was one of those 
Whom Christ came down to save. 


Yet all is well; he has but passed 
To Life's appointed bourne: 
And alien tears will fill for him 
Pity's long-broken urn, 
For his mourners be outcast men, 
And outcasts always mourn. 


V

I know not whether Laws be right, 
Or whether Laws be wrong; 
All that we know who lie in gaol 
Is that the wall is strong; 
And that each day is like a year, 
A year whose days are long. 


But this I know, that every Law 
That men have made for Man, 
Since first Man took His brother's life, 
And the sad world began, 
But straws the wheat and saves the chaff 
With a most evil fan. 


This too I know- and wise it were 
If each could know the same- 
That every prison that men build 
Is built with bricks of shame, 
And bound with bars lest Christ should see 
How men their brothers maim. 


With bars they blur the gracious moon, 
And blind the goodly sun: 
And the do well to hide their Hell, 
For in it things are done 
That Son of things nor son of Man 
Ever should look upon! 


The vilest deeds like poison weeds 
Bloom well in prison-air: 
It is only what is good in Man 
That wastes and withers there: 
Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate, 
And the warder is Despair. 


For they starve the little frightened child 
Till it weeps both night and day: 
And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool, 
And gibe the old and gray, 
And some grow mad, and all grow bad, 
And none a word may say. 


Each narrow cell in which we dwell 
Is a foul and dark latrine, 
And the fetid breath of living Death 
Chokes up each grated screen, 
And all, but Lust, is turned to dust 
In Humanity's machine. 


The brackish water that we drink 
Creeps with a loathsome slime, 
And the bitter bread they weigh in scales 
Is full of chalk and lime, 
And Sleep will not lie down, but walks 
Wild-eyed, and cries to Time. 


But though lean Hunger and green Thirst 
Like asp with adder fight, 
We have little care of prison fare, 
For what chills and kills outright 
Is that every stone one lifts by day 
Becomes one's heart by night. 


With midnight always in one's heart, 
And twilight in one's cell, 
We turn the crank, or tear the rope, 
Each in his separate Hell, 
And the silence is more awful far 
Than the sound of a brazen bell. 


And never a human voice comes near 
To speak a gentle word: 
And the eye that watches through the door 
Is pitiless and hard: 
And by all forgot, we rot and rot, 
With soul and body marred. 


And thus we rust Life's iron chain 
Degraded and alone: 
And some men curse, and some men weep, 
And some men make no moan: 
But God's eternal Laws are kind 
And break the heart of stone. 


And every human heart that breaks, 
In prison-cell or yard, 
Is as that broken box that gave 
Its treasure to the Lord, 
And filled the unclean leper's house 
With the scent of costliest nard. 


Ah! happy they whose hearts can break 
And peace of pardon win! 
How else may man make straight his plan 
And cleanse his soul from Sin? 
How else but through a broken heart 
May Lord Christ enter in? 


And he of the swollen purple throat, 
And the stark and staring eyes, 
Waits for the holy hands that took 
The Thief to Paradise; 
And a broken and a contrite heart 
The Lord will not despise. 


The man in red who reads the Law 
Gave him three weeks of life, 
Three little weeks in which to heal 
His soul of his soul's strife, 
And cleanse from every blot of blood 
The hand that held the knife. 


And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand, 
The hand that held the steel: 
For only blood can wipe out blood, 
And only tears can heal: 
And the crimson stain that was of Cain 
Became Christ's snow-white seal. 


VI

In Reading gaol by Reading town 
There is a pit of shame, 
And in it lies a wretched man 
Eaten by teeth of flame, 
In a burning winding-sheet he lies, 
And his grave has got no name. 


And there, till Christ call forth the dead, 
In silence let him lie: 
No need to waste the foolish tear, 
Or heave the windy sigh: 
The man had killed the thing he loved, 
And so he had to die. 


And all men kill the thing they love, 
By all let this be heard, 
Some do it with a bitter look, 
Some with a flattering word, 
The coward does it with a kiss, 
The brave man with a sword!",Ballad
39,Ezra Pound,"SCENE: 'En ce bourdel ou tenons nostre estat.'

It being remembered that there were six of us with Master Villon, when
that expecting presently lo be hanged he writ a ballad whereof ye know:

‘Freres humains qui apres nous vivez.'

Drink ye a skoal for the gallows tree!
Francois and Margot and thee and me,
Drink we the comrades merrily
That said us, 'Till then' for the gallows tree!

Fat Pierre with the hook gauche-main,
Thomas Larron 'Ear-the-less',
Tybalde and that armouress
Who gave this poignard its premier stain
Pinning the Guise that had been fain
To make him a mate of the 'Haulte Noblesse'
And bade her be out with ill address
As a fool that mocketh his drue's disdeign.

Drink we a skoal for the gallows tree!
Francois and Margot and thee and me,
Drink we to Marienne Ydole,
That hell brenn not her o'er cruelly.

Drink we the lusty robbers twain,
Black is the pitch o' their wedding dress,
Lips shrunk back for the wind's caress
As lips shrink back when we feel the strain

Of love that loveth in hell's disdeign,
And sense the teeth through the lips that press
'Gainst our lips for the soul's distress
That striveth to ours across the pain.

Drink we skoal to the gallows tree!
Francois and Margot and thee and me,
For Jehan and Raoul de Vallerie
Whose frames have the night and its winds in fee.

Maturin, Guillaume, Jacques d'Allmain,
Culdou lacking a coat to bless
One lean moiety of his nakedness
That plundered St. Hubert back o' the fane:
Aie! the lean bare tree is widowed again
For Michault le Borgne that would confess
In 'faith and troth' to a traitoress,
'Which of his brothers had he slain?'

But drink we skoal to the gallows tree!
Francois and Margot and thee and me:

These that we loved shall God love less
And smite always at their faibleness?

Skoal!! to the gallows! and then pray we:
God damn his hell out speedily
And bring their souls to his 'Haulte Citee'.",Ballad
40,Gilbert Keith Chesterton,"DEDICATION 

Of great limbs gone to chaos,
A great face turned to night--
Why bend above a shapeless shroud
Seeking in such archaic cloud
Sight of strong lords and light?

Where seven sunken Englands
Lie buried one by one,
Why should one idle spade, I wonder,
Shake up the dust of thanes like thunder
To smoke and choke the sun?

In cloud of clay so cast to heaven
What shape shall man discern?
These lords may light the mystery
Of mastery or victory,
And these ride high in history,
But these shall not return.

Gored on the Norman gonfalon
The Golden Dragon died:
We shall not wake with ballad strings 
The good time of the smaller things,
We shall not see the holy kings
Ride down by Severn side.

Stiff, strange, and quaintly coloured
As the broidery of Bayeux
The England of that dawn remains,
And this of Alfred and the Danes
Seems like the tales a whole tribe feigns
Too English to be true.

Of a good king on an island
That ruled once on a time;
And as he walked by an apple tree
There came green devils out of the sea
With sea-plants trailing heavily
And tracks of opal slime.

Yet Alfred is no fairy tale;
His days as our days ran,
He also looked forth for an hour
On peopled plains and skies that lower,
From those few windows in the tower
That is the head of a man.

But who shall look from Alfred's hood
Or breathe his breath alive?
His century like a small dark cloud
Drifts far; it is an eyeless crowd,
Where the tortured trumpets scream aloud
And the dense arrows drive.

Lady, by one light only
We look from Alfred's eyes,
We know he saw athwart the wreck
The sign that hangs about your neck,
Where One more than Melchizedek
Is dead and never dies.

Therefore I bring these rhymes to you
Who brought the cross to me,
Since on you flaming without flaw
I saw the sign that Guthrum saw
When he let break his ships of awe,
And laid peace on the sea.

Do you remember when we went
Under a dragon moon,
And `mid volcanic tints of night
Walked where they fought the unknown fight
And saw black trees on the battle-height,
Black thorn on Ethandune?
And I thought, ""I will go with you,
As man with God has gone,
And wander with a wandering star,
The wandering heart of things that are,
The fiery cross of love and war
That like yourself, goes on.""

O go you onward; where you are
Shall honour and laughter be,
Past purpled forest and pearled foam,
God's winged pavilion free to roam,
Your face, that is a wandering home,
A flying home for me.

Ride through the silent earthquake lands,
Wide as a waste is wide,
Across these days like deserts, when
Pride and a little scratching pen
Have dried and split the hearts of men,
Heart of the heroes, ride.

Up through an empty house of stars,
Being what heart you are,
Up the inhuman steeps of space
As on a staircase go in grace,
Carrying the firelight on your face
Beyond the loneliest star.

Take these; in memory of the hour 
We strayed a space from home
And saw the smoke-hued hamlets, quaint
With Westland king and Westland saint,
And watched the western glory faint
Along the road to Frome.




BOOK I THE VISION OF THE KING


Before the gods that made the gods
Had seen their sunrise pass,
The White Horse of the White Horse Vale
Was cut out of the grass.

Before the gods that made the gods
Had drunk at dawn their fill,
The White Horse of the White Horse Vale
Was hoary on the hill.

Age beyond age on British land,
Aeons on aeons gone,
Was peace and war in western hills,
And the White Horse looked on.

For the White Horse knew England
When there was none to know;
He saw the first oar break or bend,
He saw heaven fall and the world end,
O God, how long ago.

For the end of the world was long ago,
And all we dwell to-day
As children of some second birth,
Like a strange people left on earth
After a judgment day.

For the end of the world was long ago,
When the ends of the world waxed free,
When Rome was sunk in a waste of slaves,
And the sun drowned in the sea.

When Caesar's sun fell out of the sky
And whoso hearkened right
Could only hear the plunging
Of the nations in the night.

When the ends of the earth came marching in
To torch and cresset gleam.
And the roads of the world that lead to Rome
Were filled with faces that moved like foam,
Like faces in a dream.

And men rode out of the eastern lands,
Broad river and burning plain;
Trees that are Titan flowers to see,
And tiger skies, striped horribly,
With tints of tropic rain.

Where Ind's enamelled peaks arise
Around that inmost one,
Where ancient eagles on its brink,
Vast as archangels, gather and drink
The sacrament of the sun.

And men brake out of the northern lands,
Enormous lands alone,
Where a spell is laid upon life and lust
And the rain is changed to a silver dust
And the sea to a great green stone.

And a Shape that moveth murkily
In mirrors of ice and night,
Hath blanched with fear all beasts and birds,
As death and a shock of evil words
Blast a man's hair with white.

And the cry of the palms and the purple moons,
Or the cry of the frost and foam,
Swept ever around an inmost place,
And the din of distant race on race
Cried and replied round Rome.

And there was death on the Emperor
And night upon the Pope:
And Alfred, hiding in deep grass,
Hardened his heart with hope.

A sea-folk blinder than the sea
Broke all about his land,
But Alfred up against them bare
And gripped the ground and grasped the air,
Staggered, and strove to stand.

He bent them back with spear and spade,
With desperate dyke and wall,
With foemen leaning on his shield
And roaring on him when he reeled;
And no help came at all.

He broke them with a broken sword
A little towards the sea,
And for one hour of panting peace,
Ringed with a roar that would not cease,
With golden crown and girded fleece
Made laws under a tree.


The Northmen came about our land
A Christless chivalry:
Who knew not of the arch or pen,
Great, beautiful half-witted men
From the sunrise and the sea.

Misshapen ships stood on the deep
Full of strange gold and fire,
And hairy men, as huge as sin
With horned heads, came wading in
Through the long, low sea-mire.

Our towns were shaken of tall kings
With scarlet beards like blood:
The world turned empty where they trod,
They took the kindly cross of God
And cut it up for wood.

Their souls were drifting as the sea,
And all good towns and lands
They only saw with heavy eyes,
And broke with heavy hands,

Their gods were sadder than the sea,
Gods of a wandering will,
Who cried for blood like beasts at night,
Sadly, from hill to hill.

They seemed as trees walking the earth,
As witless and as tall,
Yet they took hold upon the heavens
And no help came at all.

They bred like birds in English woods,
They rooted like the rose,
When Alfred came to Athelney
To hide him from their bows

There was not English armour left,
Nor any English thing,
When Alfred came to Athelney
To be an English king.

For earthquake swallowing earthquake
Uprent the Wessex tree;
The whirlpool of the pagan sway
Had swirled his sires as sticks away
When a flood smites the sea.

And the great kings of Wessex
Wearied and sank in gore,
And even their ghosts in that great stress
Grew greyer and greyer, less and less,
With the lords that died in Lyonesse
And the king that comes no more.

And the God of the Golden Dragon
Was dumb upon his throne,
And the lord of the Golden Dragon
Ran in the woods alone.

And if ever he climbed the crest of luck
And set the flag before,
Returning as a wheel returns,
Came ruin and the rain that burns,
And all began once more.

And naught was left King Alfred
But shameful tears of rage,
In the island in the river
In the end of all his age.

In the island in the river
He was broken to his knee:
And he read, writ with an iron pen,
That God had wearied of Wessex men
And given their country, field and fen,
To the devils of the sea.

And he saw in a little picture,
Tiny and far away,
His mother sitting in Egbert's hall,
And a book she showed him, very small,
Where a sapphire Mary sat in stall
With a golden Christ at play.

It was wrought in the monk's slow manner,
From silver and sanguine shell,
Where the scenes are little and terrible,
Keyholes of heaven and hell.

In the river island of Athelney,
With the river running past,
In colours of such simple creed
All things sprang at him, sun and weed,
Till the grass grew to be grass indeed
And the tree was a tree at last.

Fearfully plain the flowers grew,
Like the child's book to read,
Or like a friend's face seen in a glass;
He looked; and there Our Lady was,
She stood and stroked the tall live grass
As a man strokes his steed.

Her face was like an open word
When brave men speak and choose,
The very colours of her coat
Were better than good news.

She spoke not, nor turned not,
Nor any sign she cast,
Only she stood up straight and free,
Between the flowers in Athelney,
And the river running past.

One dim ancestral jewel hung
On his ruined armour grey,
He rent and cast it at her feet:
Where, after centuries, with slow feet,
Men came from hall and school and street
And found it where it lay.

""Mother of God,"" the wanderer said,
""I am but a common king,
Nor will I ask what saints may ask,
To see a secret thing.

""The gates of heaven are fearful gates
Worse than the gates of hell;
Not I would break the splendours barred
Or seek to know the thing they guard,
Which is too good to tell.

""But for this earth most pitiful,
This little land I know,
If that which is for ever is,
Or if our hearts shall break with bliss,
Seeing the stranger go?

""When our last bow is broken, Queen,
And our last javelin cast,
Under some sad, green evening sky,
Holding a ruined cross on high,
Under warm westland grass to lie,
Shall we come home at last?""

And a voice came human but high up,
Like a cottage climbed among
The clouds; or a serf of hut and croft
That sits by his hovel fire as oft,
But hears on his old bare roof aloft
A belfry burst in song.

""The gates of heaven are lightly locked,
We do not guard our gain,
The heaviest hind may easily
Come silently and suddenly
Upon me in a lane.

""And any little maid that walks
In good thoughts apart,
May break the guard of the Three Kings
And see the dear and dreadful things
I hid within my heart.

""The meanest man in grey fields gone
Behind the set of sun,
Heareth between star and other star,
Through the door of the darkness fallen ajar,
The council, eldest of things that are,
The talk of the Three in One.

""The gates of heaven are lightly locked,
We do not guard our gold,
Men may uproot where worlds begin,
Or read the name of the nameless sin;
But if he fail or if he win
To no good man is told.

""The men of the East may spell the stars,
And times and triumphs mark,
But the men signed of the cross of Christ
Go gaily in the dark.

""The men of the East may search the scrolls
For sure fates and fame,
But the men that drink the blood of God
Go singing to their shame.

""The wise men know what wicked things
Are written on the sky,
They trim sad lamps, they touch sad strings,
Hearing the heavy purple wings,
Where the forgotten seraph kings
Still plot how God shall die.

""The wise men know all evil things
Under the twisted trees,
Where the perverse in pleasure pine
And men are weary of green wine
And sick of crimson seas.

""But you and all the kind of Christ
Are ignorant and brave,
And you have wars you hardly win
And souls you hardly save.

""I tell you naught for your comfort,
Yea, naught for your desire,
Save that the sky grows darker yet
And the sea rises higher.

""Night shall be thrice night over you,
And heaven an iron cope.
Do you have joy without a cause,
Yea, faith without a hope?""

Even as she spoke she was not,
Nor any word said he,
He only heard, still as he stood
Under the old night's nodding hood,
The sea-folk breaking down the wood
Like a high tide from sea.

He only heard the heathen men,
Whose eyes are blue and bleak,
Singing about some cruel thing
Done by a great and smiling king
In daylight on a deck.

He only heard the heathen men,
Whose eyes are blue and blind,
Singing what shameful things are done
Between the sunlit sea and the sun
When the land is left behind.




BOOK II THE GATHERING OF THE CHIEFS


Up across windy wastes and up
Went Alfred over the shaws,
Shaken of the joy of giants,
The joy without a cause.

In the slopes away to the western bays,
Where blows not ever a tree,
He washed his soul in the west wind
And his body in the sea.

And he set to rhyme his ale-measures,
And he sang aloud his laws,
Because of the joy of the giants,
The joy without a cause. 

The King went gathering Wessex men,
As grain out of the chaff
The few that were alive to die,
Laughing, as littered skulls that lie
After lost battles turn to the sky
An everlasting laugh.

The King went gathering Christian men,
As wheat out of the husk;
Eldred, the Franklin by the sea,
And Mark, the man from Italy,
And Colan of the Sacred Tree,
From the old tribe on Usk.

The rook croaked homeward heavily,
The west was clear and warm,
The smoke of evening food and ease
Rose like a blue tree in the trees
When he came to Eldred's farm.

But Eldred's farm was fallen awry,
Like an old cripple's bones,
And Eldred's tools were red with rust,
And on his well was a green crust,
And purple thistles upward thrust,
Between the kitchen stones.

But smoke of some good feasting
Went upwards evermore,
And Eldred's doors stood wide apart
For loitering foot or labouring cart,
And Eldred's great and foolish heart
Stood open like his door.

A mighty man was Eldred,
A bulk for casks to fill,
His face a dreaming furnace,
His body a walking hill.

In the old wars of Wessex
His sword had sunken deep,
But all his friends, he signed and said,
Were broken about Ethelred;
And between the deep drink and the dead
He had fallen upon sleep.

""Come not to me, King Alfred, Save always for the ale:
Why should my harmless hinds be slain
Because the chiefs cry once again,
As in all fights, that we shall gain,
And in all fights we fail?

""Your scalds still thunder and prophesy
That crown that never comes;
Friend, I will watch the certain things,
Swine, and slow moons like silver rings,
And the ripening of the plums.""

And Alfred answered, drinking,
And gravely, without blame,
""Nor bear I boast of scald or king,
The thing I bear is a lesser thing,
But comes in a better name.

""Out of the mouth of the Mother of God,
More than the doors of doom,
I call the muster of Wessex men
From grassy hamlet or ditch or den,
To break and be broken, God knows when,
But I have seen for whom.

Out of the mouth of the Mother of God
Like a little word come I;
For I go gathering Christian men
From sunken paving and ford and fen,
To die in a battle, God knows when,
By God, but I know why.

""And this is the word of Mary,
The word of the world's desire
`No more of comfort shall ye get,
Save that the sky grows darker yet
And the sea rises higher.' ""

Then silence sank. And slowly
Arose the sea-land lord,
Like some vast beast for mystery,
He filled the room and porch and sky,
And from a cobwebbed nail on high
Unhooked his heavy sword.

Up on the shrill sea-downs and up
Went Alfred all alone,
Turning but once e'er the door was shut,
Shouting to Eldred over his butt,
That he bring all spears to the woodman's hut
Hewn under Egbert's Stone.

And he turned his back and broke the fern,
And fought the moths of dusk,
And went on his way for other friends
Friends fallen of all the wide world's ends,
From Rome that wrath and pardon sends
And the grey tribes on Usk.

He saw gigantic tracks of death
And many a shape of doom,
Good steadings to grey ashes gone
And a monk's house white like a skeleton
In the green crypt of the combe.

And in many a Roman villa
Earth and her ivies eat,
Saw coloured pavements sink and fade
In flowers, and the windy colonnade
Like the spectre of a street.

But the cold stars clustered
Among the cold pines
Ere he was half on his pilgrimage
Over the western lines.

And the white dawn widened
Ere he came to the last pine,
Where Mark, the man from Italy,
Still made the Christian sign.

The long farm lay on the large hill-side,
Flat like a painted plan,
And by the side the low white house,
Where dwelt the southland man.

A bronzed man, with a bird's bright eye,
And a strong bird's beak and brow,
His skin was brown like buried gold,
And of certain of his sires was told
That they came in the shining ship of old,
With Caesar in the prow.

His fruit trees stood like soldiers
Drilled in a straight line,
His strange, stiff olives did not fail,
And all the kings of the earth drank ale,
But he drank wine.

Wide over wasted British plains
Stood never an arch or dome,
Only the trees to toss and reel,
The tribes to bicker, the beasts to squeal;
But the eyes in his head were strong like steel,
And his soul remembered Rome.

Then Alfred of the lonely spear
Lifted his lion head;
And fronted with the Italian's eye,
Asking him of his whence and why,
King Alfred stood and said:

""I am that oft-defeated King
Whose failure fills the land,
Who fled before the Danes of old,
Who chaffered with the Danes with gold,
Who now upon the Wessex wold
Hardly has feet to stand.

""But out of the mouth of the Mother of God
I have seen the truth like fire,
This--that the sky grows darker yet
And the sea rises higher.""

Long looked the Roman on the land;
The trees as golden crowns
Blazed, drenched with dawn and dew-empearled
While faintlier coloured, freshlier curled,
The clouds from underneath the world
Stood up over the downs.

""These vines be ropes that drag me hard,""
He said. ""I go not far;
Where would you meet? For you must hold
Half Wiltshire and the White Horse wold,
And the Thames bank to Owsenfold,
If Wessex goes to war.

""Guthrum sits strong on either bank
And you must press his lines
Inwards, and eastward drive him down;
I doubt if you shall take the crown
Till you have taken London town.
For me, I have the vines.""

""If each man on the Judgment Day
Meet God on a plain alone,""
Said Alfred, ""I will speak for you
As for myself, and call it true
That you brought all fighting folk you knew
Lined under Egbert's Stone.

""Though I be in the dust ere then,
I know where you will be.""
And shouldering suddenly his spear
He faded like some elfin fear,
Where the tall pines ran up, tier on tier
Tree overtoppling tree.

He shouldered his spear at morning
And laughed to lay it on,
But he leaned on his spear as on a staff,
With might and little mood to laugh,
Or ever he sighted chick or calf
Of Colan of Caerleon.

For the man dwelt in a lost land
Of boulders and broken men,
In a great grey cave far off to the south
Where a thick green forest stopped the mouth,
Giving darkness in his den.

And the man was come like a shadow,
From the shadow of Druid trees,
Where Usk, with mighty murmurings,
Past Caerleon of the fallen kings,
Goes out to ghostly seas.

Last of a race in ruin--
He spoke the speech of the Gaels;
His kin were in holy Ireland,
Or up in the crags of Wales.

But his soul stood with his mother's folk,
That were of the rain-wrapped isle,
Where Patrick and Brandan westerly
Looked out at last on a landless sea
And the sun's last smile.

His harp was carved and cunning,
As the Celtic craftsman makes,
Graven all over with twisting shapes
Like many headless snakes.

His harp was carved and cunning,
His sword prompt and sharp,
And he was gay when he held the sword,
Sad when he held the harp.

For the great Gaels of Ireland
Are the men that God made mad,
For all their wars are merry,
And all their songs are sad.

He kept the Roman order,
He made the Christian sign;
But his eyes grew often blind and bright,
And the sea that rose in the rocks at night
Rose to his head like wine.

He made the sign of the cross of God,
He knew the Roman prayer,
But he had unreason in his heart
Because of the gods that were.

Even they that walked on the high cliffs,
High as the clouds were then,
Gods of unbearable beauty,
That broke the hearts of men.

And whether in seat or saddle,
Whether with frown or smile,
Whether at feast or fight was he,
He heard the noise of a nameless sea
On an undiscovered isle.

Lifting the great green ivy
And the great spear lowering,
One said, ""I am Alfred of Wessex,
And I am a conquered king.""

And the man of the cave made answer,
And his eyes were stars of scorn,
""And better kings were conquered
Or ever your sires were born.

""What goddess was your mother,
What fay your breed begot,
That you should not die with Uther
And Arthur and Lancelot?

""But when you win you brag and blow,
And when you lose you rail,
Army of eastland yokels
Not strong enough to fail.""

""I bring not boast or railing,""
Spake Alfred not in ire,
""I bring of Our Lady a lesson set,
This--that the sky grows darker yet
And the sea rises higher.""

Then Colan of the Sacred Tree
Tossed his black mane on high,
And cried, as rigidly he rose,
""And if the sea and sky be foes,
We will tame the sea and sky.""

Smiled Alfred, ""Seek ye a fable
More dizzy and more dread
Than all your mad barbarian tales
Where the sky stands on its head ?

""A tale where a man looks down on the sky
That has long looked down on him;
A tale where a man can swallow a sea
That might swallow the seraphim.

""Bring to the hut by Egbert's Stone
All bills and bows ye have.""
And Alfred strode off rapidly,
And Colan of the Sacred Tree
Went slowly to his cave.




BOOK III THE HARP OF ALFRED


In a tree that yawned and twisted
The King's few goods were flung,
A mass-book mildewed, line by line,
And weapons and a skin of wine,
And an old harp unstrung.

By the yawning tree in the twilight
The King unbound his sword,
Severed the harp of all his goods,
And there in the cool and soundless woods
Sounded a single chord.

Then laughed; and watched the finches flash,
The sullen flies in swarm,
And went unarmed over the hills,
With the harp upon his arm,


Until he came to the White Horse Vale
And saw across the plains,
In the twilight high and far and fell,
Like the fiery terraces of hell,
The camp fires of the Danes--

The fires of the Great Army
That was made of iron men,
Whose lights of sacrilege and scorn
Ran around England red as morn,
Fires over Glastonbury Thorn--
Fires out on Ely Fen.

And as he went by White Horse Vale
He saw lie wan and wide
The old horse graven, God knows when,
By gods or beasts or what things then
Walked a new world instead of men
And scrawled on the hill-side.

And when he came to White Horse Down
The great White Horse was grey,
For it was ill scoured of the weed,
And lichen and thorn could crawl and feed,
Since the foes of settled house and creed
Had swept old works away.

King Alfred gazed all sorrowful
At thistle and mosses grey,
Then laughed; and watched the finches flash,
Till a rally of Danes with shield and bill
Rolled drunk over the dome of the hill,
And, hearing of his harp and skill,
They dragged him to their play.

And as they went through the high green grass
They roared like the great green sea;
But when they came to the red camp fire
They were silent suddenly.

And as they went up the wastes away
They went reeling to and fro;
But when they came to the red camp fire
They stood all in a row.

For golden in the firelight,
With a smile carved on his lips,
And a beard curled right cunningly,
Was Guthrum of the Northern Sea,
The emperor of the ships--

With three great earls King Guthrum
Went the rounds from fire to fire,
With Harold, nephew of the King,
And Ogier of the Stone and Sling,
And Elf, whose gold lute had a string
That sighed like all desire.

The Earls of the Great Army
That no men born could tire,
Whose flames anear him or aloof
Took hold of towers or walls of proof,
Fire over Glastonbury roof
And out on Ely, fire.

And Guthrum heard the soldiers' tale
And bade the stranger play;
Not harshly, but as one on high,
On a marble pillar in the sky,
Who sees all folk that live and die--
Pigmy and far away.

And Alfred, King of Wessex,
Looked on his conqueror--
And his hands hardened; but he played,
And leaving all later hates unsaid,
He sang of some old British raid
On the wild west march of yore.

He sang of war in the warm wet shires,
Where rain nor fruitage fails,
Where England of the motley states
Deepens like a garden to the gates
In the purple walls of Wales.

He sang of the seas of savage heads
And the seas and seas of spears,
Boiling all over Offa's Dyke,
What time a Wessex club could strike
The kings of the mountaineers.

Till Harold laughed and snatched the harp,
The kinsman of the King,
A big youth, beardless like a child,
Whom the new wine of war sent wild,
Smote, and began to sing--

And he cried of the ships as eagles
That circle fiercely and fly,
And sweep the seas and strike the towns
From Cyprus round to Skye.

How swiftly and with peril
They gather all good things,
The high horns of the forest beasts,
Or the secret stones of kings.

""For Rome was given to rule the world,
And gat of it little joy--
But we, but we shall enjoy the world,
The whole huge world a toy.

""Great wine like blood from Burgundy,
Cloaks like the clouds from Tyre,
And marble like solid moonlight,
And gold like frozen fire.

""Smells that a man might swill in a cup,
Stones that a man might eat,
And the great smooth women like ivory
That the Turks sell in the street.""

He sang the song of the thief of the world,
And the gods that love the thief;
And he yelled aloud at the cloister-yards,
Where men go gathering grief.

""Well have you sung, O stranger,
Of death on the dyke in Wales,
Your chief was a bracelet-giver;
But the red unbroken river
Of a race runs not for ever,
But suddenly it fails.

""Doubtless your sires were sword-swingers
When they waded fresh from foam,
Before they were turned to women
By the god of the nails from Rome;

""But since you bent to the shaven men,
Who neither lust nor smite,
Thunder of Thor, we hunt you
A hare on the mountain height.""

King Guthrum smiled a little,
And said, ""It is enough,
Nephew, let Elf retune the string;
A boy must needs like bellowing,
But the old ears of a careful king
Are glad of songs less rough.""

Blue-eyed was Elf the minstrel,
With womanish hair and ring,
Yet heavy was his hand on sword,
Though light upon the string.

And as he stirred the strings of the harp
To notes but four or five,
The heart of each man moved in him
Like a babe buried alive.

And they felt the land of the folk-songs
Spread southward of the Dane,
And they heard the good Rhine flowing
In the heart of all Allemagne.

They felt the land of the folk-songs,
Where the gifts hang on the tree,
Where the girls give ale at morning
And the tears come easily.

The mighty people, womanlike,
That have pleasure in their pain
As he sang of Balder beautiful,
Whom the heavens loved in vain.

As he sang of Balder beautiful,
Whom the heavens could not save,
Till the world was like a sea of tears
And every soul a wave. 

""There is always a thing forgotten
When all the world goes well;
A thing forgotten, as long ago,
When the gods forgot the mistletoe,
And soundless as an arrow of snow
The arrow of anguish fell.

""The thing on the blind side of the heart,
On the wrong side of the door,
The green plant groweth, menacing
Almighty lovers in the spring;
There is always a forgotten thing,
And love is not secure.""

And all that sat by the fire were sad,
Save Ogier, who was stern,
And his eyes hardened, even to stones,
As he took the harp in turn;

Earl Ogier of the Stone and Sling
Was odd to ear and sight,
Old he was, but his locks were red,
And jests were all the words he said
Yet he was sad at board and bed
And savage in the fight.

""You sing of the young gods easily
In the days when you are young;
But I go smelling yew and sods,
And I know there are gods behind the gods,
Gods that are best unsung.

""And a man grows ugly for women,
And a man grows dull with ale,
Well if he find in his soul at last
Fury, that does not fail.

""The wrath of the gods behind the gods
Who would rend all gods and men,
Well if the old man's heart hath still
Wheels sped of rage and roaring will,
Like cataracts to break down and kill,
Well for the old man then--

""While there is one tall shrine to shake,
Or one live man to rend;
For the wrath of the gods behind the gods
Who are weary to make an end.

""There lives one moment for a man
When the door at his shoulder shakes,
When the taut rope parts under the pull,
And the barest branch is beautiful
One moment, while it breaks.

""So rides my soul upon the sea
That drinks the howling ships,
Though in black jest it bows and nods
Under the moons with silver rods,
I know it is roaring at the gods,
Waiting the last eclipse.

""And in the last eclipse the sea
Shall stand up like a tower,
Above all moons made dark and riven,
Hold up its foaming head in heaven,
And laugh, knowing its hour.

""And the high ones in the happy town
Propped of the planets seven,
Shall know a new light in the mind,
A noise about them and behind,
Shall hear an awful voice, and find
Foam in the courts of heaven.

""And you that sit by the fire are young,
And true love waits for you;
But the king and I grow old, grow old,
And hate alone is true.""

And Guthrum shook his head but smiled,
For he was a mighty clerk,
And had read lines in the Latin books
When all the north was dark.

He said, ""I am older than you, Ogier;
Not all things would I rend,
For whether life be bad or good
It is best to abide the end.""

He took the great harp wearily,
Even Guthrum of the Danes,
With wide eyes bright as the one long day
On the long polar plains.

For he sang of a wheel returning,
And the mire trod back to mire,
And how red hells and golden heavens
Are castles in the fire.

""It is good to sit where the good tales go,
To sit as our fathers sat;
But the hour shall come after his youth,
When a man shall know not tales but truth,
And his heart fail thereat.

""When he shall read what is written
So plain in clouds and clods,
When he shall hunger without hope
Even for evil gods.

""For this is a heavy matter,
And the truth is cold to tell;
Do we not know, have we not heard,
The soul is like a lost bird,
The body a broken shell.

""And a man hopes, being ignorant,
Till in white woods apart
He finds at last the lost bird dead:
And a man may still lift up his head
But never more his heart.

""There comes no noise but weeping
Out of the ancient sky,
And a tear is in the tiniest flower
Because the gods must die.

""The little brooks are very sweet,
Like a girl's ribbons curled,
But the great sea is bitter
That washes all the world.

""Strong are the Roman roses,
Or the free flowers of the heath,
But every flower, like a flower of the sea,
Smelleth with the salt of death.

""And the heart of the locked battle
Is the happiest place for men;
When shrieking souls as shafts go by
And many have died and all may die;
Though this word be a mystery,
Death is most distant then.

""Death blazes bright above the cup,
And clear above the crown;
But in that dream of battle
We seem to tread it down.

""Wherefore I am a great king,
And waste the world in vain,
Because man hath not other power,
Save that in dealing death for dower,
He may forget it for an hour
To remember it again.""

And slowly his hands and thoughtfully
Fell from the lifted lyre,
And the owls moaned from the mighty trees
Till Alfred caught it to his knees
And smote it as in ire.

He heaved the head of the harp on high
And swept the framework barred,
And his stroke had all the rattle and spark
Of horses flying hard.

""When God put man in a garden
He girt him with a sword,
And sent him forth a free knight
That might betray his lord;

""He brake Him and betrayed Him,
And fast and far he fell,
Till you and I may stretch our necks
And burn our beards in hell.

""But though I lie on the floor of the world,
With the seven sins for rods,
I would rather fall with Adam
Than rise with all your gods.

""What have the strong gods given?
Where have the glad gods led?
When Guthrum sits on a hero's throne
And asks if he is dead?

""Sirs, I am but a nameless man,
A rhymester without home,
Yet since I come of the Wessex clay
And carry the cross of Rome,

""I will even answer the mighty earl
That asked of Wessex men
Why they be meek and monkish folk,
And bow to the White Lord's broken yoke;
What sign have we save blood and smoke?
Here is my answer then.

""That on you is fallen the shadow,
And not upon the Name;
That though we scatter and though we fly,
And you hang over us like the sky,
You are more tired of victory,
Than we are tired of shame.

""That though you hunt the Christian man
Like a hare on the hill-side,
The hare has still more heart to run
Than you have heart to ride.

""That though all lances split on you,
All swords be heaved in vain,
We have more lust again to lose
Than you to win again.

""Your lord sits high in the saddle,
A broken-hearted king,
But our king Alfred, lost from fame,
Fallen among foes or bo",
ds of shame,,,
In I know not what mean trade or name,,,
Has still some song to sing;,,,
,,,
Our monks go robed in rain and snow,,,
But the heart of flame therein,,,
But you go clothed in feasts and flames,,,
When all is ice within;,,,
,,,
Nor shall all iron dooms make dumb,,,
Men wondering ceaselessly,,,
If it be not better to fast for joy,,,
Than feast for misery.,,,
,,,
Nor monkish order only,,,
Slides down, as field to fen,,
All things achieved and chosen pass,,,
As the White Horse fades in the grass,,,
No work of Christian men.,,,
,,,
Ere the sad gods that made your gods,,,
Saw their sad sunrise pass,,,
The White Horse of the White Horse Vale,,,
That you have left to darken and fail,,,
Was cut out of the grass.,,,
,,,
Therefore your end is on you,,,
Is on you and your kings,,,
Not for a fire in Ely fen,,,
Not that your gods are nine or ten,,,
But because it is only Christian men,,,
Guard even heathen things.,,,
,,,
For our God hath blessed creation,,,
Calling it good. I know,,,
What spirit with whom you blindly band,,,
Hath blessed destruction with his hand;,,,
Yet by God's death the stars shall stand,,,
"And the small apples grow.""""",,,
,,,
And the King, with harp on shoulder,,
Stood up and ceased his song;,,,
And the owls moaned from the mighty trees,,,
And the Danes laughed loud and long.,,,

BOOK IV THE WOMAN IN THE FOREST,,,
,,,
,,,
Thick thunder of the snorting swine,,,
Enormous in the gloam,,,
Rending among all roots that cling,,,
And the wild horses whinnying,,,
Were the night's noises when the King,,,
Shouldering his harp, went home.,,
,,,
With eyes of owl and feet of fox,,,
Full of all thoughts he went;,,,
He marked the tilt of the pagan camp,,,
The paling of pine, the sentries' tramp,,
And the one great stolen altar-lamp,,,
Over Guthrum in his tent.,,,
,,,
By scrub and thorn in Ethandune ,,,
That night the foe had lain;,,,
Whence ran across the heather grey,,,
The old stones of a Roman way; ,,,
And in a wood not far away,,,
The pale road split in twain.,,,
,,,
He marked the wood and the cloven ways,,,
With an old captain's eyes,,,
And he thought how many a time had he,,,
Sought to see Doom he could not see;,,,
How ruin had come and victory,,,
And both were a surprise.,,,
,,,
Even so he had watched and wondered,,,
Under Ashdown from the plains;,,,
With Ethelred praying in his tent,,,
Till the white hawthorn swung and bent,,,
As Alfred rushed his spears and rent,,,
The shield-wall of the Danes.,,,
,,,
Even so he had watched and wondered,,,
Knowing neither less nor more,,,
Till all his lords lay dying,,,
And axes on axes plying,,,
Flung him, and drove him flying,,
Like a pirate to the shore.,,,
,,,
Wise he had been before defeat,,,
And wise before success;,,,
Wise in both hours and ignorant,,,
Knowing neither more nor less.,,,
,,,
As he went down to the river-hut,,,
He knew a night-shade scent,,,
Owls did as evil cherubs rise,,,
With little wings and lantern eyes,,,
As though he sank through the under-skies;,,,
But down and down he went.,,,
,,,
As he went down to the river-hut,,,
He went as one that fell;,,,
Seeing the high forest domes and spars.,,,
Dim green or torn with golden scars,,,
As the proud look up at the evil stars,,,
In the red heavens of hell.,,,
,,,
For he must meet by the river-hut,,,
Them he had bidden to arm,,,
Mark from the towers of Italy,,,
And Colan of the Sacred Tree,,,
And Eldred who beside the sea,,,
Held heavily his farm.,,,
,,,
The roof leaned gaping to the grass,,,
As a monstrous mushroom lies;,,,
Echoing and empty seemed the place;,,,
But opened in a little space,,,
A great grey woman with scarred face,,,
And strong and humbled eyes.,,,
,,,
King Alfred was but a meagre man,,,
Bright eyed, but lean and pale:,,
And swordless, with his harp and rags,,
He seemed a beggar, such as lags,,
Looking for crusts and ale.,,,
,,,
And the woman, with a woman's eyes,,
Of pity at once and ire,,,
Said, when that she had glared a span,,
There is a cake for any man,,,
"If he will watch the fire.""""",,,
,,,
And Alfred, bowing heavily,,
Sat down the fire to stir,,,
And even as the woman pitied him,,,
So did he pity her.,,,
,,,
Saying," """"O great heart in the night",,
O best cast forth for worst,,,
Twilight shall melt and morning stir,,,
And no kind thing shall come to her,,,
Till God shall turn the world over,,,
And all the last are first.,,,
,,,
And well may God with the serving-folk,,,
Cast in His dreadful lot;,,,
Is not He too a servant,,,
And is not He forgot ?,,,
,,,
For was not God my gardener,,,
And silent like a slave;,,,
That opened oaks on the uplands,,,
Or thicket in graveyard gave?,,,
,,,
And was not God my armourer,,,
All patient and unpaid,,,
That sealed my skull as a helmet,,,
And ribs for hauberk made?,,,
,,,
Did not a great grey servant,,,
Of all my sires and me,,,
Build this pavilion of the pines,,,
And herd the fowls and fill the vines,,,
And labour and pass and leave no signs,,,
Save mercy and mystery?,,,
,,,
For God is a great servant,,,
And rose before the day,,,
From some primordial slumber torn;,,,
But all we living later born,,,
Sleep on, and rise after the morn,,
And the Lord has gone away.,,,
,,,
On things half sprung from sleeping,,,
All sleepy suns have shone,,,
They stretch stiff arms, the yawning trees,,
The beasts blink upon hands and knees,,,
Man is awake and does and sees--,,,
But Heaven has done and gone.,,,
,,,
For who shall guess the good riddle,,,
Or speak of the Holiest,,,
Save in faint figures and failing words,,,
Who loves, yet laughs among the swords,,
Labours, and is at rest?,,
,,,
But some see God like Guthrum,,,
Crowned, with a great beard curled,,
But I see God like a good giant,,,
That, labouring,,
,,,
Wherefore was God in Golgotha,,,
Slain as a serf is slain;,,,
And hate He had of prince and peer,,,
And love He had and made good cheer,,,
Of them that, like this woman here,,
Go powerfully in pain.,,,
,,,
But in this grey morn of man's life,,,
Cometh sometime to the mind,,,
A little light that leaps and flies,,,
Like a star blown on the wind.,,,
,,,
A star of nowhere, a nameless star,,
A light that spins and swirls,,,
And cries that even in hedge and hill,,,
Even on earth, it may go ill,,
At last with the evil earls.,,,
,,,
A dancing sparkle, a doubtful star,,
On the waste wind whirled and driven;,,,
But it seems to sing of a wilder worth,,,
A time discrowned of doom and birth,,,
And the kingdom of the poor on earth,,,
Come, as it is in heaven.,,
,,,
But even though such days endure,,,
How shall it profit her?,,,
Who shall go groaning to the grave,,,
With many a meek and mighty slave,,,
Field-breaker and fisher on the wave,,,
And woodman and waggoner.,,,
,,,
Bake ye the big world all again,,,
A cake with kinder leaven;,,,
Yet these are sorry evermore--,,,
Unless there be a little door,,,
"A little door in heaven.""""",,,
,,,
And as he wept for the woman,,,
He let her business be,,,
And like his royal oath and rash,,,
The good food fell upon the ash,,,
And blackened instantly.,,,
,,,
Screaming, the woman caught a cake,,
Yet burning from the bar,,,
And struck him suddenly on the face,,,
Leaving a scarlet scar.,,,
,,,
King Alfred stood up wordless,,,
A man dead with surprise,,,
And torture stood and the evil things,,,
That are in the childish hearts of kings,,,
An instant in his eyes.,,,
,,,
And even as he stood and stared,,,
Drew round him in the dusk,,,
Those friends creeping from far-off farms,,,
Marcus with all his slaves in arms,,,
And the strange spears hung with ancient charms,,,
Of Colan of the Usk.,,,
,,,
With one whole farm marching afoot,,,
The trampled road resounds,,,
Farm-hands and farm-beasts blundering by,,,
And jars of mead and stores of rye,,,
Where Eldred strode above his high,,,
And thunder-throated hounds.,,,
,,,
And grey cattle and silver lowed,,,
Against the unlifted morn,,,
And straw clung to the spear-shafts tall.,,,
And a boy went before them all,,,
Blowing a ram's horn.,,,
,,,
As mocking such rude revelry,,,
The dim clan of the Gael,,,
Came like a bad king's burial-end,,,
With dismal robes that drop and rend,,,
And demon pipes that wail--,,,
,,,
In long, outlandish garments,,
Torn, though of antique worth,,
With Druid beards and Druid spears,,,
As a resurrected race appears,,,
Out of an elder earth.,,,
,,,
And though the King had called them forth,,,
And knew them for his own,,,
So still each eye stood like a gem,,,
So spectral hung each broidered hem,,,
Grey carven men he fancied them,,,
Hewn in an age of stone.,,,
,,,
And the two wild peoples of the north,,,
Stood fronting in the gloam,,,
And heard and knew each in its mind,,,
The third great thunder on the wind,,,
The living walls that hedge mankind,,,
The walking walls of Rome.,,,
,,,
Mark's were the mixed tribes of the west,,,
Of many a hue and strain,,,
Gurth, with rank hair like yellow grass,,
And the Cornish fisher, Gorlias,,
And Halmer, come from his first mass,,
Lately baptized, a Dane.,,
,,,
But like one man in armour,,,
Those hundreds trod the field,,,
From red Arabia to the Tyne,,,
The earth had heard that marching-line,,,
Since the cry on the hill Capitoline,,,
And the fall of the golden shield.,,,
,,,
And the earth shook and the King stood still,,,
Under the greenwood bough,,,
And the smoking cake lay at his feet,,,
And the blow was on his brow.,,,
,,,
Then Alfred laughed out suddenly,,,
Like thunder in the spring,,,
Till shook aloud the lintel-beams,,,
And the squirrels stirred in dusty dreams,,,
And the startled birds went up in streams,,,
For the laughter of the King.,,,
,,,
And the beasts of the earth and the birds looked down,,,
In a wild solemnity,,,
On a stranger sight than a sylph or elf,,,
On one man laughing at himself,,,
Under the greenwood tree--,,,
,,,
The giant laughter of Christian men,,,
That roars through a thousand tales,,,
Where greed is an ape and pride is an ass,,,
And Jack's away with his master's lass,,,
And the miser is banged with all his brass,,,
The farmer with all his flails;,,,
,,,
Tales that tumble and tales that trick,,,
Yet end not all in scorning--,,,
Of kings and clowns in a merry plight,,,
And the clock gone wrong and the world gone right,,,
That the mummers sing upon Christmas night,,,
And Christmas Day in the morning.,,,
,,,
Now here is a good warrant,,,
Cried Alfred," """"by my sword;",,
For he that is struck for an ill servant,,,
Should be a kind lord.,,,
,,,
He that has been a servant,,,
Knows more than priests and kings,,,
But he that has been an ill servant,,,
He knows all earthly things.,,,
,,,
Pride flings frail palaces at the sky,,,
As a man flings up sand,,,
But the firm feet of humility,,,
Take hold of heavy land.,,,
,,,
Pride juggles with her toppling towers,,,
They strike the sun and cease,,,
But the firm feet of humility,,,
They grip the ground like trees.,,,
,,,
He that hath failed in a little thing,,,
Hath a sign upon the brow;,,,
And the Earls of the Great Army,,,
Have no such seal to show.,,,
,,,
The red print on my forehead,,,
Small flame for a red star,,,
In the van of the violent marching, then,,
When the sky is torn of the trumpets ten,,,
And the hands of the happy howling men,,,
Fling wide the gates of war.,,,
,,,
This blow that I return not,,,
Ten times will I return,,,
On kings and earls of all degree,,,
And armies wide as empires be,,,
Shall slide like landslips to the sea,,,
If the red star burn.,,,
,,,
One man shall drive a hundred,,,
As the dead kings drave;,,,
Before me rocking hosts be riven,,,
And battering cohorts backwards driven,,,
For I am the first king known of Heaven,,,
That has been struck like a slave.,,,
,,,
Up on the old white road, brothers,,
Up on the Roman walls!,,,
For this is the night of the drawing of swords,,,
And the tainted tower of the heathen hordes,,,
Leans to our hammers, fires and cords,,
Leans a little and falls.,,,
,,,
Follow the star that lives and leaps,,,
Follow the sword that sings,,,
For we go gathering heathen men,,,
A terrible harvest, ten by ten,,
As the wrath of the last red autumn--then,,,
When Christ reaps down the kings.,,,
,,,
Follow a light that leaps and spins,,,
Follow the fire unfurled!,,,
For riseth up against realm and rod,,,
A thing forgotten, a thing downtrod,,
The last lost giant, even God,,
"Is risen against the world.""""",,,
,,,
Roaring they went o'er the Roman wall,,,
And roaring up the lane,,,
Their torches tossed a ladder of fire,,,
Higher their hymn was heard and higher,,,
More sweet for hate and for heart's desire,,,
And up in the northern scrub and brier,,,
They fell upon the Dane.,,,
,,,
,,,
,,,
,,,
BOOK V ETHANDUNE: THE FIRST STROKE,,,
,,,
,,,
King Guthrum was a dread king,,,
Like death out of the north;,,,
Shrines without name or number,,,
He rent and rolled as lumber,,,
From Chester to the Humber,,,
He drove his foemen forth.,,,
,,,
The Roman villas heard him,,,
In the valley of the Thames,,,
Come over the hills roaring,,,
Above their roofs, and pouring,,
On spire and stair and flooring,,,
Brimstone and pitch and flames.,,,
,,,
Sheer o'er the great chalk uplands,,,
And the hill of the Horse went he,,,
Till high on Hampshire beacons,,,
He saw the southern sea.,,,
,,,
High on the heights of Wessex,,,
He saw the southern brine,,,
And turned him to a conquered land,,,
And where the northern thornwoods stand,,,
And the road parts on either hand,,,
There came to him a sign.,,,
,,,
King Guthrum was a war-chief,,,
A wise man in the field,,,
And though he prospered well, and knew,,
How Alfred's folk were sad and few,,,
Not less with weighty care he drew,,,
Long lines for pike and shield.,,,
,,,
King Guthrum lay on the upper land,,,
On a single road at gaze,,,
And his foe must come with lean array,,,
Up the left arm of the cloven way,,,
To the meeting of the ways.,,,
,,,
And long ere the noise of armour,,,
An hour ere the break of light,,,
The woods awoke with crash and cry,,,
And the birds sprang clamouring harsh and high,,,
And the rabbits ran like an elves' army,,,
Ere Alfred came in sight.,,,
,,,
The live wood came at Guthrum,,,
On foot and claw and wing,,,
The nests were noisy overhead,,,
For Alfred and the star of red,,,
All life went forth, and the forest fled,,
Before the face of the King.,,,
,,,
But halted in the woodways,,,
Christ's few were grim and grey,,,
And each with a small, far,,
Saw the high folly of the fight;,,,
And though strange joys had grown in the night,,,
Despair grew with the day.,,,
,,,
And when white dawn crawled through the wood,,,
Like cold foam of a flood,,,
Then weakened every warrior's mood,,,
In hope, though not in hardihood;,,
And each man sorrowed as he stood,,,
In the fashion of his blood.,,,
,,,
For the Saxon Franklin sorrowed,,,
For the things that had been fair;,,,
For the dear dead woman, crimson-clad,,
And the great feasts and the friends he had;,,,
But the Celtic prince's soul was sad,,,
For the things that never were.,,,
,,,
In the eyes Italian all things,,,
But a black laughter died;,,,
And Alfred flung his shield to earth,,,
And smote his breast and cried--,,,
,,,
I wronged a man to his slaying,,,
And a woman to her shame,,,
And once I looked on a sworn maid,,,
That was wed to the Holy Name.,,,
,,,
And once I took my neighbour's wife,,,
That was bound to an eastland man,,,
In the starkness of my evil youth,,,
Before my griefs began.,,,
,,,
People, if you have any prayers,,
Say prayers for me:,,,
And lay me under a Christian stone,,,
In that lost land I thought my own,,,
To wait till the holy horn is blown,,,
"And all poor men are free.""""",,,
,,,
Then Eldred of the idle farm,,,
Leaned on his ancient sword,,,
As fell his heavy words and few;,,,
And his eyes were of such alien blue,,,
As gleams where the Northman saileth new,,,
Into an unknown fiord.,,,
,,,
I was a fool and wasted ale--,,,
My slaves found it sweet;,,,
I was a fool and wasted bread,,,
And the birds had bread to eat.,,,
,,,
The kings go up and the kings go down,,,
And who knows who shall rule;,,,
Next night a king may starve or sleep,,,
But men and birds and beasts shall weep,,,
At the burial of a fool.,,,
,,,
O, drunkards in my cellar,,
Boys in my apple tree,,,
The world grows stern and strange and new,,,
And wise men shall govern you,,,
And you shall weep for me.,,,
,,,
But yoke me my own oxen,,,
Down to my own farm;,,,
My own dog will whine for me,,,
My own friends will bend the knee,,,
And the foes I slew openly,,,
"Have never wished me harm.""""",,,
,,,
And all were moved a little,,,
But Colan stood apart,,,
Having first pity, and after,,
Hearing, like rat in rafter,,
That little worm of laughter,,,
That eats the Irish heart.,,,
,,,
And his grey-green eyes were cruel,,,
And the smile of his mouth waxed hard,,,
And he said," """"And when did Britain",,
Become your burying-yard?,,,
,,,
Before the Romans lit the land,,,
When schools and monks were none,,,
We reared such stones to the sun-god,,,
As might put out the sun.,,,
,,,
The tall trees of Britain,,,
We worshipped and were wise,,,
But you shall raid the whole land through,,,
And never a tree shall talk to you,,,
Though every leaf is a tongue taught true,,,
And the forest is full of eyes.,,,
,,,
On one round hill to the seaward,,,
The trees grow tall and grey,,,
And the trees talk together,,,
When all men are away.,,,
,,,
O'er a few round hills forgotten,,,
The trees grow tall in rings,,,
And the trees talk together,,,
Of many pagan things.,,,
,,,
Yet I could lie and listen,,,
With a cross upon my clay,,,
And hear unhurt for ever,,,
"What the trees of Britain say.""""",,,
,,,
A proud man was the Roman,,,
His speech a single one,,,
But his eyes were like an eagle's eyes,,,
That is staring at the sun.,,,
,,,
Dig for me where I die, he said,,
If first or last I fall--,,,
Dead on the fell at the first charge,,,
Or dead by Wantage wall;,,,
,,,
Lift not my head from bloody ground,,,
Bear not my body home,,,
For all the earth is Roman earth,,,
"And I shall die in Rome.""""",,,
,,,
Then Alfred, King of England,,
Bade blow the horns of war,,,
And fling the Golden Dragon out,,,
With crackle and acclaim and shout,,,
Scrolled and aflame and far.,,,
,,,
And under the Golden Dragon,,,
Went Wessex all along,,,
Past the sharp point of the cloven ways,,,
Out from the black wood into the blaze,,,
Of sun and steel and song.,,,
,,,
And when they came to the open land,,,
They wheeled, deployed and stood;,,
Midmost were Marcus and the King,,,
And Eldred on the right-hand wing,,,
And leftwards Colan darkling,,,
In the last shade of the wood.,,,
,,,
But the Earls of the Great Army,,,
Lay like a long half moon,,,
Ten poles before their palisades,,,
With wide-winged helms and runic blades,,,
Red giants of an age of raids,,,
In the thornland of Ethandune.,,,
,,,
Midmost the saddles rose and swayed,,,
And a stir of horses' manes,,,
Where Guthrum and a few rode high,,,
On horses seized in victory;,,,
But Ogier went on foot to die,,,
In the old way of the Danes.,,,
,,,
Far to the King's left Elf the bard,,,
Led on the eastern wing,,,
With songs and spells that change the blood;,,,
And on the King's right Harold stood,,,
The kinsman of the King.,,,
,,,
Young Harold, coarse,,
Smoking with oil and musk,,,
And the pleasant violence of the young,,,
Pushed through his people, giving tongue,,
Foewards, where,,
The banners of the Usk.,,,
,,,
But as he came before his line,,,
A little space along,,,
His beardless face broke into mirth,,,
"And he cried: """"What broken bits of earth",,,
Are here? For what their clothes are worth,,,
"I would sell them for a song.""""",,,
,,,
For Colan was hung with raiment,,,
Tattered like autumn leaves,,,
And his men were all as thin as saints,,,
And all as poor as thieves.,,,
,,,
No bows nor slings nor bolts they bore,,,
But bills and pikes ill-made;,,,
And none but Colan bore a sword,,,
And rusty was its blade.,,,
,,,
And Colan's eyes with mystery,,,
And iron laughter stirred,,,
And he spoke aloud, but lightly,,
Not labouring to be heard.,,,
,,,
Oh, truly we be broken hearts,,
For that cause, it is said,,
We light our candles to that Lord,,,
That broke Himself for bread.,,,
,,,
But though we hold but bitterly,,,
What land the Saxon leaves,,,
Though Ireland be but a land of saints,,,
And Wales a land of thieves,,,
,,,
I say you yet shall weary,,,
Of the working of your word,,,
That stricken spirits never strike,,,
Nor lean hands hold a sword.,,,
,,,
And if ever ye ride in Ireland,,,
The jest may yet be said,,,
There is the land of broken hearts,,,
"And the land of broken heads.""""",,,
,,,
Not less barbarian laughter,,,
Choked Harold like a flood,,,
And shall I fight with scarecrows,,,
That am of Guthrum's blood?,,,
,,,
Meeting may be of war-men,,,
Where the best war-man wins;,,,
But all this carrion a man shoots,,,
"Before the fight begins.""""",,,
,,,
And stopping in his onward strides,,,
He snatched a bow in scorn,,,
From some mean slave, and bent it on,,
Colan, whose doom grew dark; and shone,,
Stars evil over Caerleon,,,
In the place where he was born.,,,
,,,
For Colan had not bow nor sling,,,
On a lonely sword leaned he,,,
Like Arthur on Excalibur,,,
In the battle by the sea.,,,
,,,
To his great gold ear-ring Harold,,,
Tugged back the feathered tail,,,
And swift had sprung the arrow,,,
But swifter sprang the Gael.,,,
,,,
Whirling the one sword round his head,,,
A great wheel in the sun,,,
He sent it splendid through the sky,,,
Flying before the shaft could fly--,,,
It smote Earl Harold over the eye,,,
And blood began to run.,,,
,,,
Colan stood bare and weaponless,,,
Earl Harold, as in pain,,
Strove for a smile, put hand to head,,
Stumbled and suddenly fell dead;,,,
And the small white daisies all waxed red,,,
With blood out of his brain.,,,
,,,
And all at that marvel of the sword,,,
Cast like a stone to slay,,,
"Cried out. Said Alfred: """"Who would see",,,
Signs, must give all things. Verily,,
Man shall not taste of victory,,,
"Till he throws his sword away.""""",,,
,,,
Then Alfred, prince of England,,
And all the Christian earls,,,
Unhooked their swords and held them up,,,
Each offered to Colan, like a cup,,
Of chrysolite and pearls.,,,
,,,
And the King said," """"Do thou take my sword",,
Who have done this deed of fire,,,
For this is the manner of Christian men,,,
Whether of steel or priestly pen,,,
That they cast their hearts out of their ken,,,
To get their heart's desire.,,,
,,,
And whether ye swear a hive of monks,,,
Or one fair wife to friend,,,
This is the manner of Christian men,,,
That their oath endures the end.,,,
,,,
For love, our Lord,,
Sits a red horse like a throne,,,
With a brazen helm and an iron bow,,,
But one arrow alone.,,,
,,,
Love with the shield of the Broken Heart,,,
Ever his bow doth bend,,,
With a single shaft for a single prize,,,
And the ultimate bolt that parts and flies,,,
Comes with a thunder of split skies,,,
And a sound of souls that rend.,,,
,,,
So shall you earn a king's sword,,,
"Who cast your sword away.""""",,,
And the King took, with a random eye,,
A rude axe from a hind hard by,,,
And turned him to the fray.,,,
,,,
For the swords of the Earls of Daneland,,,
Flamed round the fallen lord.,,,
The first blood woke the trumpet-tune,,,
As in monk's rhyme or wizard's rune,,,
Beginneth the battle of Ethandune,,,
With the throwing of the sword.,,,
,,,
,,,
,,,
,,,
BOOK VI ETHANDUNE: THE SLAYING OF THE CHIEFS,,,
,,,
,,,
As the sea flooding the flat sands,,,
Flew on the sea-born horde,,,
The two hosts shocked with dust and din,,,
Left of the Latian paladin,,,
Clanged all Prince Harold's howling kin,,,
On Colan and the sword.,,,
,,,
Crashed in the midst on Marcus,,,
Ogier with Guthrum by,,,
And eastward of such central stir,,,
Far to the right and faintlier,,,
The house of Elf the harp-player,,,
Struck Eldred's with a cry.,,,
,,,
The centre swat for weariness,,,
Stemming the screaming horde,,,
And wearily went Colan's hands,,,
That swung King Alfred's sword.,,,
,,,
But like a cloud of morning,,,
To eastward easily,,,
Tall Eldred broke the sea of spears,,,
As a tall ship breaks the sea.,,,
,,,
His face like a sanguine sunset,,,
His shoulder a Wessex down,,,
His hand like a windy hammer-stroke;,,,
Men could not count the crests he broke,,,
So fast the crests went down.,,,
,,,
As the tall white devil of the Plague,,,
Moves out of Asian skies,,,
With his foot on a waste of cities,,,
And his head in a cloud of flies;,,,
,,,
Or purple and peacock skies grow dark,,,
With a moving locust-tower;,,,
Or tawny sand-winds tall and dry,,,
Like hell's red banners beat and fly,,,
When death comes out of Araby,,,
Was Eldred in his hour.,,,
,,,
But while he moved like a massacre,,,
He murmured as in sleep,,,
And his words were all of low hedges,,,
And little fields and sheep.,,,
,,,
Even as he strode like a pestilence,,,
That strides from Rhine to Rome,,,
He thought how tall his beans might be,,,
If ever he went home.,,,
,,,
Spoke some stiff piece of childish prayer,,,
Dull as the distant chimes,,,
That thanked our God for good eating,,,
And corn and quiet times--,,,
,,,
Till on the helm of a high chief,,,
Fell shatteringly his brand,,,
And the helm broke and the bone broke,,,
And the sword broke in his hand.,,,
,,,
Then from the yelling Northmen,,,
Driven splintering on him ran,,,
Full seven spears, and the seventh,,
Was never made by man.,,,
,,,
Seven spears, and the seventh,,
Was wrought as the faerie blades,,,
And given to Elf the minstrel,,,
By the monstrous water-maids;,,,
,,,
By them that dwell where luridly,,,
Lost waters of the Rhine,,,
Move among roots of nations,,,
Being sunken for a sign.,,,
,,,
Under all graves they murmur,,,
They murmur and rebel,,,
Down to the buried kingdoms creep,,,
And like a lost rain roar and weep,,,
O'er the red heavens of hell.,,,
,,,
Thrice drowned was Elf the minstrel,,,
And washed as dead on sand;,,,
And the third time men found him,,,
The spear was in his hand.,,,
,,,
Seven spears went about Eldred,,,
Like stays about a mast;,,,
But there was sorrow by the sea,,,
For the driving of the last.,,,
,,,
Six spears thrust upon Eldred,,,
Were splintered while he laughed;,,,
One spear thrust into Eldred,,,
Three feet of blade and shaft.,,,
,,,
And from the great heart grievously,,,
Came forth the shaft and blade,,,
And he stood with the face of a dead man,,,
Stood a little, and swayed--,,
,,,
Then fell, as falls a battle-tower,,
On smashed and struggling spears.,,,
Cast down from some unconquered town,,,
That, rushing earthward,,
Loads of live men of all renown--,,,
Archers and engineers.,,,
,,,
And a great clamour of Christian men,,,
Went up in agony,,,
Crying," """"Fallen is the tower of Wessex",,
"That stood beside the sea.""""",,,
,,,
Centre and right the Wessex guard,,,
Grew pale for doubt and fear,,,
And the flank failed at the advance,,,
For the death-light on the wizard lance--,,,
The star of the evil spear.,,,
,,,
Stand like an oak, cried Marcus,,
Stand like a Roman wall!,,,
Eldred the Good is fallen--,,,
Are you too good to fall?,,,
,,,
When we were wan and bloodless,,,
He gave you ale enow;,,,
The pirates deal with him as dung,,,
"God! are you bloodless now?""""",,,
,,,
Grip, Wulf and Gorlias,,
Slaves, and I make you free!,,
Stamp, Hildred hard in English land,,
Stand Gurth, stand Gorlias,,
Hold, Halfgar,,
Halmer, hold up on knee!,,
,,,
The lamps are dying in your homes,,,
The fruits upon your bough;,,,
Even now your old thatch smoulders, Gurth,,
Now is the judgment of the earth,,,
Now is the death-grip," now!""""",,
,,,
For thunder of the captain,,,
Not less the Wessex line,,,
Leaned back and reeled a space to rear,,,
As Elf charged with the Rhine maids' spear,,,
And roaring like the Rhine.,,,
,,,
For the men were borne by the waving walls,,,
Of woods and clouds that pass,,,
By dizzy plains and drifting sea,,,
And they mixed God with glamoury,,,
God with the gods of the burning tree,,,
And the wizard's tower and glass.,,,
,,,
But Mark was come of the glittering towns,,,
Where hot white details show,,,
Where men can number and expound,,,
And his faith grew in a hard ground,,,
Of doubt and reason and falsehood found,,,
Where no faith else could grow.,,,
,,,
Belief that grew of all beliefs,,,
One moment back was blown,,,
And belief that stood on unbelief,,,
Stood up iron and alone.,,,
,,,
The Wessex crescent backwards,,,
Crushed, as with bloody spear,,
Went Elf roaring and routing,,,
And Mark against Elf yet shouting,,,
Shocked, in his mid-career.,,
,,,
Right on the Roman shield and sword,,,
Did spear of the Rhine maids run;,,,
But the shield shifted never,,,
The sword rang down to sever,,,
The great Rhine sang for ever,,,
And the songs of Elf were done.,,,
,,,
And a great thunder of Christian men,,,
Went up against the sky,,,
Saying," """"God hath broken the evil spear",,
"Ere the good man's blood was dry.""""",,,
,,,
"Spears at the charge!"""" yelled Mark amain.",,,
Death on the gods of death!,,,
Over the thrones of doom and blood,,,
Goeth God that is a craftsman good,,,
And gold and iron, earth and wood,,
Loveth and laboureth.,,,
,,,
The fruits leap up in all your farms,,,
The lamps in each abode;,,,
God of all good things done on earth,,,
All wheels or webs of any worth,,,
The God that makes the roof, Gurth,,
The God that makes the road.,,,
,,,
The God that heweth kings in oak,,,
Writeth songs on vellum,,,
God of gold and flaming glass,,,
Confregit potentias,,,
Acrcuum, scutum,,
"Gladium et bellum.""""",,,
,,,
Steel and lightning broke about him,,,
Battle-bays and palm,,,
All the sea-kings swayed among,,,
Woods of the Wessex arms upflung,,,
The trumpet of the Roman tongue,,,
The thunder of the psalm.,,,
,,,
And midmost of that rolling field,,,
Ran Ogier ragingly,,,
Lashing at Mark, who turned his blow,,
And brake the helm about his brow,,,
And broke him to his knee.,,,
,,,
Then Ogier heaved over his head,,,
His huge round shield of proof;,,,
But Mark set one foot on the shield,,,
One on some sundered rock upheeled,,,
And towered above the tossing field,,,
A statue on a roof.,,,
,,,
Dealing far blows about the fight,,,
Like thunder-bolts a-roam,,,
Like birds about the battle-field,,,
While Ogier writhed under his shield,,,
Like a tortoise in his dome.,,,
,,,
But hate in the buried Ogier,,,
Was strong as pain in hell,,,
With bare brute hand from the inside,,,
He burst the shield of brass and hide,,,
And a death-stroke to the Roman's side,,,
Sent suddenly and well.,,,
,,,
Then the great statue on the shield,,,
Looked his last look around,,,
With level and imperial eye;,,,
And Mark, the man from Italy,,
Fell in the sea of agony,,,
And died without a sound.,,,
,,,
And Ogier, leaping up alive,,
Hurled his huge shield away,,,
Flying, as when a juggler flings,,
A whizzing plate in play.,,,
,,,
And held two arms up rigidly,,,
And roared to all the Danes:,,,
Fallen is Rome, yea,,
The city of the plains!,,,
,,,
Shall no man born remember,,,
That breaketh wood or weald,,,
How long she stood on the roof of the world,,,
As he stood on my shield.,,,
,,,
The new wild world forgetteth her,,,
As foam fades on the sea,,,
How long she stood with her foot on Man,,,
As he with his foot on me.,,,
,,,
No more shall the brown men of the south,,,
Move like the ants in lines,,,
To quiet men with olives,,,
Or madden men with vines.,,,
,,,
No more shall the white towns of the south,,,
Where Tiber and Nilus run,,,
Sitting around a secret sea,,,
Worship a secret sun.,,,
,,,
The blind gods roar for Rome fallen,,,
And forum and garland gone,,,
For the ice of the north is broken,,,
And the sea of the north comes on.,,,
,,,
The blind gods roar and rave and dream,,,
Of all cities under the sea,,,
For the heart of the north is broken,,,
And the blood of the north is free.,,,
,,,
Down from the dome of the world we come,,,
Rivers on rivers down,,,
Under us swirl the sects and hordes,,,
And the high dooms we drown.,,,
,,,
Down from the dome of the world and down,,,
Struck flying as a skiff,,,
On a river in spate is spun and swirled,,,
Until we come to the end of the world,,,
That breaks short, like a cliff.,,
,,,
And when we come to the end of the world,,,
For me, I count it fit,,
To take the leap like a good river,,,
Shot shrieking over it.,,,
,,,
But whatso hap at the end of the world,,,
Where Nothing is struck and sounds,,,
It is not, by Thor,,
These humbled Wessex hounds--,,,
,,,
Not this pale line of Christian hinds,,,
This one white string of men,,,
Shall keep us back from the end of the world,,,
And the things that happen then.,,,
,,,
It is not Alfred's dwarfish sword,,,
Nor Egbert's pigmy crown,,,
Shall stay us now that descend in thunder,,,
Rending the realms and the realms thereunder,,,
"Down through the world and down.""""",,,
,,,
There was that in the wild men back of him,,,
There was that in his own wild song,,,
A dizzy throbbing, a drunkard smoke,,
That dazed to death all Wessex folk,,,
And swept their spears along.,,,
,,,
Vainly the sword of Colan,,,
And the axe of Alfred plied--,,,
The Danes poured in like a brainless plague,,,
And knew not when they died.,,,
,,,
Prince Colan slew a score of them,,,
And was stricken to his knee;,,,
King Alfred slew a score and seven,,,
And was borne back on a tree.,,,
,,,
Back to the black gate of the woods,,,
Back up the single way,,,
Back by the place of the parting ways,,,
Christ's knights were whirled away.,,,
,,,
And when they came to the parting ways,,,
Doom's heaviest hammer fell,,,
For the King was beaten, blind,,
Down the right lane with his array,,,
But Colan swept the other way,,,
Where he smote great strokes and fell.,,,
,,,
The thorn-woods over Ethandune,,,
Stand sharp and thick as spears,,,
By night and furze and forest-harms,,,
Far sundered were the friends in arms;,,,
The loud lost blows, the last alarms,,
Came not to Alfred's ears.,,,
,,,
The thorn-woods over Ethandune,,,
Stand stiff as spikes in mail;,,,
As to the Haut King came at morn,,,
Dead Roland on a doubtful horn,,,
Seemed unto Alfred lightly borne,,,
The last cry of the Gael.,,,
,,,
,,,
,,,
,,,
BOOK VIII ETHANDUNE: THE LAST CHARGE,,,
,,,
,,,
Away in the waste of White Horse Down,,,
An idle child alone,,,
Played some small game through hours that pass,,,
And patiently would pluck the grass,,,
Patiently push the stone.,,,
,,,
On the lean, green edge for ever,,
Where the blank chalk touched the turf,,,
The child played on, alone,,
As a child plays on the last line,,,
That sunders sand and surf.,,,
,,,
For he dwelleth in high divisions,,,
Too simple to understand,,,
Seeing on what morn of mystery,,,
The Uncreated rent the sea,,,
With roarings, from the land.,,
,,,
Through the long infant hours like days,,,
He built one tower in vain--,,,
Piled up small stones to make a town,,,
And evermore the stones fell down,,,
And he piled them up again.,,,
,,,
And crimson kings on battle-towers,,,
And saints on Gothic spires,,,
And hermits on their peaks of snow,,,
And heroes on their pyres,,,
,,,
And patriots riding royally,,,
That rush the rocking town,,,
Stretch hands, and hunger and aspire,,
Seeking to mount where high and higher,,,
The child whom Time can never tire,,,
Sings over White Horse Down.,,,
,,,
And this was the might of Alfred,,,
At the ending of the way;,,,
That of such smiters, wise or wild,,
He was least distant from the child,,,
Piling the stones all day.,,,
,,,
For Eldred fought like a frank hunter,,,
That killeth and goeth home;,,,
And Mark had fought because all arms,,,
Rang like the name of Rome.,,,
,,,
And Colan fought with a double mind,,,
Moody and madly gay;,,,
But Alfred fought as gravely,,,
As a good child at play.,,,
,,,
He saw wheels break and work run back,,,
And all things as they were;,,,
And his heart was orbed like victory,,,
And simple like despair.,,,
,,,
Therefore is Mark forgotten,,,
That was wise with his tongue and brave;,,,
And the cairn over Colan crumbled,,,
And the cross on Eldred's grave.,,,
,,,
Their great souls went on a wind away,,,
And they have not tale or tomb;,,,
And Alfred born in Wantage,,,
Rules England till the doom.,,,
,,,
Because in the forest of all fears,,,
Like a strange fresh gust from sea,,,
Struck him that ancient innocence,,,
That is more than mastery.,,,
,,,
And as a child whose bricks fall down,,,
Re-piles them o'er and o'er,,,
Came ruin and the rain that burns,,,
Returning as a wheel returns,,,
And crouching in the furze and ferns,,,
He began his life once more.,,,
,,,
He took his ivory horn unslung,,,
And smiled, but not in scorn:,,
Endeth the Battle of Ethandune,,,
"With the blowing of a horn.""""",,,
,,,
On a dark horse at the double way,,,
He saw great Guthrum ride,,,
Heard roar of brass and ring of steel,,,
The laughter and the trumpet peal,,,
The pagan in his pride.,,,
,,,
And Ogier's red and hated head,,,
Moved in some talk or task;,,,
But the men seemed scattered in the brier,,,
And some of them had lit a fire,,,
And one had broached a cask.,,,
,,,
And waggons one or two stood up,,,
Like tall ships in sight,,,
As if an outpost were encamped,,,
At the cloven ways for night.,,,
,,,
And joyous of the sudden stay,,,
Of Alfred's routed few,,,
Sat one upon a stone to sigh,,,
And some slipped up the road to fly,,,
Till Alfred in the fern hard by,,,
Set horn to mouth and blew.,,,
,,,
And they all abode like statues--,,,
One sitting on the stone,,,
One half-way through the thorn hedge tall,,,
One with a leg across a wall,,,
And one looked backwards, very small,,
Far up the road, alone.,,
,,,
Grey twilight and a yellow star,,,
Hung over thorn and hill;,,,
Two spears and a cloven war-shield lay,,,
Loose on the road as cast away,,,
The horn died faint in the forest grey,,,
And the fleeing men stood still.,,,
,,,
Brothers at arms, said Alfred,,
On this side lies the foe;,,,
Are slavery and starvation flowers,,,
That you should pluck them so?,,,
,,,
For whether is it better,,,
To be prodded with Danish poles,,,
Having hewn a chamber in a ditch,,,
And hounded like a howling witch,,,
Or smoked to death in holes?,,,
,,,
Or that before the red cock crow,,,
All we, a thousand strong,,
Go down the dark road to God's house,,,
Singing a Wessex song?,,,
,,,
To sweat a slave to a race of slaves,,,
To drink up infamy?,,,
No, brothers, I think,
Death is a better ale to drink,,,
And by all the stars of Christ that sink,,,
The Danes shall drink with me.,,,
,,,
To grow old cowed in a conquered land,,,
With the sun itself discrowned,,,
To see trees crouch and cattle slink--,,,
Death is a better ale to drink,,,
And by high Death on the fell brink,,,
That flagon shall go round.,,,
,,,
Though dead are all the paladins,,,
Whom glory had in ken,,,
Though all your thunder-sworded thanes,,,
With proud hearts died among the Danes,,,
While a man remains, great war remains:,,
Now is a war of men.,,,
,,,
The men that tear the furrows,,,
The men that fell the trees,,,
When all their lords be lost and dead,,,
The bondsmen of the earth shall tread,,,
The tyrants of the seas.,,,
,,,
The wheel of the roaring stillness,,,
Of all labours under the sun,,,
Speed the wild work as well at least,,,
As the whole world's work is done.,,,
,,,
Let Hildred hack the shield-wall,,,
Clean as he hacks the hedge;,,,
Let Gurth the fowler stand as cool,,,
As he stands on the chasm's edge;,,,
,,,
Let Gorlias ride the sea-kings,,,
As Gorlias rides the sea,,,
Then let all hell and Denmark drive,,,
Yelling to all its fiends alive,,,
"And not a rag care we.""""",,,
,,,
When Alfred's word was ended,,,
Stood firm that feeble line,,,
Each in his place with club or spear,,,
And fury deeper than deep fear,,,
And smiles as sour as brine.,,,
,,,
And the King held up the horn and said,,,
See ye my father's horn,,,
That Egbert blew in his empery,,,
Once, when he rode out commonly,,
Twice when he rode for venery,,,
And thrice on the battle-morn.,,,
,,,
But heavier fates have fallen,,,
The horn of the Wessex kings,,,
And I blew once, the riding sign,,
To call you to the fighting line,,,
And glory and all good things.,,,
,,,
And now two blasts, the hunting sign,,
Because we turn to bay;,,,
But I will not blow the three blasts,,,
Till we be lost or they.,,,
,,,
And now I blow the hunting sign,,,
Charge some by rule and rod;,,,
But when I blow the battle sign,,,
"Charge all and go to God.""""",,,
,,,
Wild stared the Danes at the double ways,,,
Where they loitered, all at large,,
As that dark line for the last time,,,
Doubled the knee to charge--,,,
,,,
And caught their weapons clumsily,,,
And marvelled how and why--,,,
In such degree, by rule and rod,,
The people of the peace of God,,,
Went roaring down to die.,,,
,,,
And when the last arrow,,,
Was fitted and was flown,,,
When the broken shield hung on the breast,,,
And the hopeless lance was laid in rest,,,
And the hopeless horn blown,,,
,,,
The King looked up, and what he saw,,
Was a great light like death,,,
For Our Lady stood on the standards rent,,,
As lonely and as innocent,,,
As when between white walls she went,,,
And the lilies of Nazareth.,,,
,,,
One instant in a still light,,,
He saw Our Lady then,,,
Her dress was soft as western sky,,,
And she was a queen most womanly--,,,
But she was a queen of men.,,,
,,,
Over the iron forest,,,
He saw Our Lady stand,,,
Her eyes were sad withouten art,,,
And seven swords were in her heart--,,,
But one was in her hand.,,,
,,,
Then the last charge went blindly,,,
And all too lost for fear:,,,
The Danes closed round, a roaring ring,,
And twenty clubs rose o'er the King,,,
Four Danes hewed at him, halloing,,
And Ogier of the Stone and Sling,,,
Drove at him with a spear.,,,
,,,
But the Danes were wild with laughter,,,
And the great spear swung wide,,,
The point stuck to a straggling tree,,,
And either host cried suddenly,,,
As Alfred leapt aside.,,,
,,,
Short time had shaggy Ogier,,,
To pull his lance in line--,,,
He knew King Alfred's axe on high,,,
He heard it rushing through the sky,,,
,,,
He cowered beneath it with a cry--,,,
It split him to the spine:,,,
And Alfred sprang over him dead,,,
And blew the battle sign.,,,
,,,
Then bursting all and blasting,,,
Came Christendom like death,,,
Kicked of such catapults of will,,,
The staves shiver, the barrels spill,,
The waggons waver and crash and kill,,,
The waggoners beneath.,,,
,,,
Barriers go backwards, banners rend,,
Great shields groan like a gong--,,,
Horses like horns of nightmare,,,
Neigh horribly and long.,,,
,,,
Horses ramp high and rock and boil,,,
And break their golden reins,,,
And slide on carnage clamorously,,,
Down where the bitter blood doth lie,,,
Where Ogier went on foot to die,,,
In the old way of the Danes.,,,
,,,
"The high tide!"""" King Alfred cried.",,,
The high tide and the turn!,,,
As a tide turns on the tall grey seas,,,
See how they waver in the trees,,,
How stray their spears, how knock their knees,,
How wild their watchfires burn!,,,
,,,
The Mother of God goes over them,,,
Walking on wind and flame,,,
And the storm-cloud drifts from city and dale,,,
And the White Horse stamps in the White Horse Vale,,,
And we all shall yet drink Christian ale,,,
In the village of our name.,,,
,,,
The Mother of God goes over them,,,
On dreadful cherubs borne;,,,
And the psalm is roaring above the rune,,,
And the Cross goes over the sun and moon,,,
Endeth the battle of Ethandune,,,
"With the blowing of a horn.""""",,,
,,,
For back indeed disorderly,,,
The Danes went clamouring,,,
Too worn to take anew the tale,,,
Or dazed with insolence and ale,,,
Or stunned of heaven, or stricken pale,,
Before the face of the King.,,,
,,,
For dire was Alfred in his hour,,,
The pale scribe witnesseth,,,
More mighty in defeat was he,,,
Than all men else in victory,,,
And behind, his men came murderously,,
Dry-throated, drinking death.,,
,,,
And Edgar of the Golden Ship,,,
He slew with his own hand,,,
Took Ludwig from his lady's bower,,,
And smote down Harmar in his hour,,,
And vain and lonely stood the tower--,,,
The tower in Guelderland.,,,
,,,
And Torr out of his tiny boat,,,
Whose eyes beheld the Nile,,,
Wulf with his war-cry on his lips,,,
And Harco born in the eclipse,,,
Who blocked the Seine with battleships,,,
Round Paris on the Isle.,,,
,,,
And Hacon of the Harvest-Song,,,
And Dirck from the Elbe he slew,,,
And Cnut that melted Durham bell,,,
And Fulk and fiery Oscar fell,,,
And Goderic and Sigael,,,
And Uriel of the Yew.,,,
,,,
And highest sang the slaughter,,,
And fastest fell the slain,,,
When from the wood-road's blackening throat,,,
A crowning and crashing wonder smote,,,
The rear-guard of the Dane.,,,
,,,
For the dregs of Colan's company--,,,
Lost down the other road--,,,
Had gathered and grown and heard the din,,,
And with wild yells came pouring in,,,
Naked as their old British kin,,,
And bright with blood for woad.,,,
,,,
And bare and bloody and aloft,,,
They bore before their band,,,
The body of the mighty lord,,,
Colan of Caerleon and its horde,,,
That bore King Alfred's battle-sword,,,
Broken in his left hand.,,,
,,,
And a strange music went with him,,,
Loud and yet strangely far;,,,
The wild pipes of the western land,,,
Too keen for the ear to understand,,,
Sang high and deathly on each hand,,,
When the dead man went to war.,,,
,,,
Blocked between ghost and buccaneer,,,
Brave men have dropped and died;,,,
And the wild sea-lords well might quail,,,
As the ghastly war-pipes of the Gael,,,
Called to the horns of White Horse Vale,,,
And all the horns replied.,,,
,,,
And Hildred the poor hedger,,,
Cut down four captains dead,,,
And Halmar laid three others low,,,
And the great earls wavered to and fro,,,
For the living and the dead.,,,
,,,
And Gorlias grasped the great flag,,,
The Raven of Odin, torn;,,
And the eyes of Guthrum altered,,,
For the first time since morn.,,,
,,,
As a turn of the wheel of tempest,,,
Tilts up the whole sky tall,,,
And cliffs of wan cloud luminous,,,
Lean out like great walls over us,,,
As if the heavens might fall.,,,
,,,
As such a tall and tilted sky,,,
Sends certain snow or light,,,
So did the eyes of Guthrum change,,,
And the turn was more certain and more strange,,,
Than a thousand men in flight.,,,
,,,
For not till the floor of the skies is split,,,
And hell-fire shines through the sea,,,
Or the stars look up through the rent earth's knees,,,
Cometh such rending of certainties,,,
As when one wise man truly sees,,,
What is more wise than he.,,,
,,,
He set his horse in the battle-breech,,,
Even Guthrum of the Dane,,,
And as ever had fallen fell his brand,,,
A falling tower o'er many a land,,,
But Gurth the fowler laid one hand,,,
Upon this bridle rein.,,,
,,,
King Guthrum was a great lord,,,
And higher than his gods--,,,
He put the popes to laughter,,,
He chid the saints with rods,,,
,,,
He took this hollow world of ours,,,
For a cup to hold his wine;,,,
In the parting of the woodways,,,
There came to him a sign.,,,
,,,
In Wessex in the forest,,,
In the breaking of the spears,,,
We set a sign on Guthrum,,,
To blaze a thousand years.,,,
,,,
Where the high saddles jostle,,,
And the horse-tails toss,,,
There rose to the birds flying,,,
A roar of dead and dying;,,,
In deafness and strong crying,,,
We signed him with the cross.,,,
,,,
Far out to the winding river,,,
The blood ran down for days,,,
When we put the cross on Guthrum,,,
In the parting of the ways.,,,

BOOK VIII THE SCOURING OF THE HORSE,,,
,,,
,,,
In the years of the peace of Wessex,,,
When the good King sat at home;,,,
Years following on that bloody boon,,,
When she that stands above the moon,,,
Stood above death at Ethandune,,,
And saw his kingdom come--,,,
,,,
When the pagan people of the sea,,,
Fled to their palisades,,,
Nailed there with javelins to cling,,,
And wonder smote the pirate king,,,
And brought him to his christening,,,
And the end of all his raids.,,,
,,,
(For not till the night's blue slate is wiped,,,
Of its last star utterly,,,
And fierce new signs writ there to read,,,
Shall eyes with such amazement heed,,,
As when a great man knows indeed,,,
A greater thing than he.),,,
,,,
And there came to his chrism-loosing,,,
Lords of all lands afar,,,
And a line was drawn north-westerly,,,
That set King Egbert's empire free,,,
Giving all lands by the northern sea,,,
To the sons of the northern star.,,,
,,,
In the days of the rest of Alfred,,,
When all these things were done,,,
And Wessex lay in a patch of peace,,,
Like a dog in a patch of sun--,,,
,,,
The King sat in his orchard,,,
Among apples green and red,,,
With the little book in his bosom,,,
And the sunshine on his head.,,,
,,,
And he gathered the songs of simple men,,,
That swing with helm and hod,,,
And the alms he gave as a Christian,,,
Like a river alive with fishes ran;,,,
And he made gifts to a beggar man,,,
As to a wandering god.,,,
,,,
And he gat good laws of the ancient kings,,,
Like treasure out of the tombs;,,,
And many a thief in thorny nook,,,
Or noble in sea-stained turret shook,,,
For the opening of his iron book,,,
And the gathering of the dooms.,,,
,,,
Then men would come from the ends of the earth,,,
Whom the King sat welcoming,,,
And men would go to the ends of the earth,,,
Because of the word of the King.,,,
,,,
For folk came in to Alfred's face,,,
Whose javelins had been hurled,,,
On monsters that make boil the sea,,,
Crakens and coils of mystery.,,,
Or thrust in ancient snows that be,,,
The white hair of the world.,,,
,,,
And some had knocked at the northern gates,,,
Of the ultimate icy floor,,,
Where the fish freeze and the foam turns black,,,
And the wide world narrows to a track,,,
And the other sea at the world's back,,,
Cries through a closed door.,,,
,,,
And men went forth from Alfred's face,,,
Even great gift-bearing lords,,,
Not to Rome only, but more bold,,
Out to the high hot courts of old,,,
Of negroes clad in cloth of gold,,,
Silence, and crooked swords,,
,,,
Scrawled screens and secret gardens,,,
And insect-laden skies--,,,
Where fiery plains stretch on and on,,,
To the purple country of Prester John,,,
And the walls of Paradise.,,,
,,,
And he knew the might of the Terre Majeure,,,
Where kings began to reign;,,,
Where in a night-rout, without name,,
Of gloomy Goths and Gauls there came,,,
White, above candles all aflame,,
Like a vision, Charlemagne.,,
,,,
And men, seeing such embassies,,
Spake with the King and said:,,,
The steel that sang so sweet a tune,,,
On Ashdown and on Ethandune,,,
Why hangs it scabbarded so soon,,,
All heavily like lead?,,,
,,,
Why dwell the Danes in North England,,,
And up to the river ride?,,,
Three more such marches like thine own,,,
Would end them; and the Pict should own,,,
Our sway; and our feet climb the throne,,,
"In the mountains of Strathclyde.""""",,,
,,,
And Alfred in the orchard,,,
Among apples green and red,,,
With the little book in his bosom,,,
Looked at green leaves and said:,,,
,,,
When all philosophies shall fail,,,
This word alone shall fit;,,,
That a sage feels too small for life,,,
And a fool too large for it.,,,
,,,
Asia and all imperial plains,,,
Are too little for a fool;,,,
But for one man whose eyes can see,,,
The little island of Athelney,,,
Is too large a land to rule.,,,
,,,
Haply it had been better,,,
When I built my fortress there,,,
Out in the reedy waters wide,,,
I had stood on my mud wall and cried:,,,
`Take England all, from tide to tide--,,
Be Athelney my share.',,,
,,,
Those madmen of the throne-scramble--,,,
Oppressors and oppressed--,,,
Had lined the banks by Athelney,,,
And waved and wailed unceasingly,,,
Where the river turned to the broad sea,,,
By an island of the blest.,,,
,,,
An island like a little book,,,
Full of a hundred tales,,,
Like the gilt page the good monks pen,,,
That is all smaller than a wren,,,
Yet hath high towns, meteors,,
And suns and spouting whales;,,,
,,,
A land having a light on it,,,
In the river dark and fast,,,
An isle with utter clearness lit,,,
Because a saint had stood in it;,,,
Where flowers are flowers indeed and fit,,,
And trees are trees at last.,,,
,,,
So were the island of a saint;,,,
But I am a common king,,,
And I will make my fences tough,,,
From Wantage Town to Plymouth Bluff,,,
Because I am not wise enough,,,
"To rule so small a thing.""""",,,
,,,
And it fell in the days of Alfred,,,
In the days of his repose,,,
That as old customs in his sight,,,
Were a straight road and a steady light,,,
He bade them keep the White Horse white,,,
As the first plume of the snows.,,,
,,,
And right to the red torchlight,,,
From the trouble of morning grey,,,
They stripped the White Horse of the grass,,,
As they strip it to this day.,,,
,,,
And under the red torchlight,,,
He went dreaming as though dull,,,
Of his old companions slain like kings,,,
And the rich irrevocable things,,,
Of a heart that hath not openings,,,
But is shut fast, being full.,,
,,,
And the torchlight touched the pale hair,,,
Where silver clouded gold,,,
And the frame of his face was made of cords,,,
And a young lord turned among the lords,,,
"And said: """"The King is old.""""",,,
,,,
And even as he said it,,,
A post ran in amain,,,
"Crying: """"Arm", Lord King,,
In the horror and the shade of harm,,,
They have burnt Brand of Aynger's farm--,,,
The Danes are come again!,,,
,,,
Danes drive the white East Angles,,,
In six fights on the plains,,,
Danes waste the world about the Thames,,,
"Danes to the eastward--Danes!""""",,,
,,,
And as he stumbled on one knee,,,
The thanes broke out in ire,,,
"Crying: """"Ill the watchmen watch", and ill,,
"The sheriffs keep the shire.""""",,,
,,,
"But the young earl said: """"Ill the saints",,,
The saints of England, guard,,
The land wherein we pledge them gold;,,,
The dykes decay, the King grows old,,
And surely this is hard,,,
,,,
That we be never quit of them;,,,
That when his head is hoar,,,
He cannot say to them he smote,,,
And spared with a hand hard at the throat,,,
`Go," and return no more.' """"",,
,,,
Then Alfred smiled. And the smile of him,,,
Was like the sun for power.,,,
But he only pointed: bade them heed,,,
Those peasants of the Berkshire breed,,,
Who plucked the old Horse of the weed,,,
As they pluck it to this hour.,,,
,,,
Will ye part with the weeds for ever?,,,
Or show daisies to the door?,,,
Or will you bid the bold grass,,,
Go, and return no more?,,
,,,
So ceaseless and so secret,,,
Thrive terror and theft set free;,,,
Treason and shame shall come to pass,,,
While one weed flowers in a morass;,,,
And like the stillness of stiff grass,,,
The stillness of tyranny.,,,
,,,
Over our white souls also,,,
Wild heresies and high,,,
Wave prouder than the plumes of grass,,,
And sadder than their sigh.,,,
,,,
And I go riding against the raid,,,
And ye know not where I am;,,,
But ye shall know in a day or year,,,
When one green star of grass grows here;,,,
Chaos has charged you, charger and spear,,
Battle-axe and battering-ram.,,,
,,,
And though skies alter and empires melt,,,
This word shall still be true:,,,
If we would have the horse of old,,,
Scour ye the horse anew.,,,
,,,
One time I followed a dancing star,,,
That seemed to sing and nod,,,
And ring upon earth all evil's knell;,,,
But now I wot if ye scour not well,,,
Red rust shall grow on God's great bell,,,
"And grass in the streets of God.""""",,,
,,,
Ceased Alfred; and above his head,,,
The grand green domes, the Downs,,
Showed the first legions of the press,,,
Marching in haste and bitterness,,,
For Christ's sake and the crown's.,,,
,,,
Beyond the cavern of Colan,,,
Past Eldred's by the sea,,,
Rose men that owned King Alfred's rod,,,
From the windy wastes of Exe untrod,,,
Or where the thorn of the grave of God,,,
Burns over Glastonbury.,,,
,,,
Far northward and far westward,,,
The distant tribes drew nigh,,,
Plains beyond plains, fell beyond fell,,
That a man at sunset sees so well,,,
And the tiny coloured towns that dwell,,,
In the corners of the sky.,,,
,,,
But dark and thick as thronged the host,,,
With drum and torch and blade,,,
The still-eyed King sat pondering,,,
As one that watches a live thing,,,
The scoured chalk; and he said,,,
,,,
Though I give this land to Our Lady,,,
That helped me in Athelney,,,
Though lordlier trees and lustier sod,,,
And happier hills hath no flesh trod,,,
Than the garden of the Mother of God,,,
Between Thames side and the sea,,,
,,,
I know that weeds shall grow in it,,,
Faster than men can burn;,,,
And though they scatter now and go,,,
In some far century, sad and slow,,
I have a vision, and I know,,
The heathen shall return.,,,
,,,
They shall not come with warships,,,
They shall not waste with brands,,,
But books be all their eating,,,
And ink be on their hands.,,,
,,,
Not with the humour of hunters,,,
Or savage skill in war,,,
But ordering all things with dead words,,,
Strings shall they make of beasts and birds,,,
And wheels of wind and star.,,,
,,,
They shall come mild as monkish clerks,,,
With many a scroll and pen;,,,
And backward shall ye turn and gaze,,,
Desiring one of Alfred's days,,,
When pagans still were men.,,,
,,,
The dear sun dwarfed of dreadful suns,,,
Like fiercer flowers on stalk,,,
Earth lost and little like a pea,,,
In high heaven's towering forestry,,,
#NAME?,,,
Crawl, covering the chalk.,,
,,,
But though they bridge St. Mary's sea,,,
Or steal St. Michael's wing--,,,
Though they rear marvels over us,,,
Greater than great Vergilius,,,
Wrought for the Roman king;,,,
,,,
By this sign you shall know them,,,
The breaking of the sword,,,
And man no more a free knight,,,
That loves or hates his lord.,,,
,,,
Yea, this shall be the sign of them,,
The sign of the dying fire;,,,
And Man made like a half-wit,,,
That knows not of his sire.,,,
,,,
What though they come with scroll and pen,,,
And grave as a shaven clerk,,,
By this sign you shall know them,,,
That they ruin and make dark;,,,
,,,
By all men bond to Nothing,,,
Being slaves without a lord,,,
By one blind idiot world obeyed,,,
Too blind to be abhorred;,,,
,,,
By terror and the cruel tales,,,
Of curse in bone and kin,,,
By weird and weakness winning,,,
Accursed from the beginning,,,
By detail of the sinning,,,
And denial of the sin;,,,
,,,
By thought a crawling ruin,,,
By life a leaping mire,,,
By a broken heart in the breast of the world,,,
And the end of the world's desire;,,,
,,,
By God and man dishonoured,,,
By death and life made vain,,,
Know ye the old barbarian,,,
The barbarian come again--,,,
,,,
When is great talk of trend and tide,,,
And wisdom and destiny,,,
Hail that undying heathen,,,
That is sadder than the sea.,,,
,,,
In what wise men shall smite him,,,
Or the Cross stand up again,,,
Or charity or chivalry,,,
My vision saith not; and I see,,,
No more; but now ride doubtfully,,,
"To the battle of the plain.""""",,,
,,,
And the grass-edge of the great down,,,
Was cut clean as a lawn,,,
While the levies thronged from near and far,,,
From the warm woods of the western star,,,
And the King went out to his last war,,,
On a tall grey horse at dawn.,,,
,,,
And news of his far-off fighting,,,
Came slowly and brokenly,,,
From the land of the East Saxons,,,
From the sunrise and the sea.,,,
,,,
From the plains of the white sunrise,,,
And sad St. Edmund's crown,,,
Where the pools of Essex pale and gleam,,,
Out beyond London Town--,,,
,,,
In mighty and doubtful fragments,,,
Like faint or fabled wars,,,
Climbed the old hills of his renown,,,
Where the bald brow of White Horse Down,,,
Is close to the cold stars.,,,
,,,
But away in the eastern places,,,
The wind of death walked high,,,
And a raid was driven athwart the raid,,,
The sky reddened and the smoke swayed,,,
And the tall grey horse went by.,,,
,,,
The gates of the great river,,,
Were breached as with a barge,,,
The walls sank crowded, say the scribes,,
And high towers populous with tribes,,,
Seemed leaning from the charge.,,,
,,,
Smoke like rebellious heavens rolled,,,
Curled over coloured flames,,,
Mirrored in monstrous purple dreams,,,
In the mighty pools of Thames.,,,
,,,
Loud was the war on London wall,,,
And loud in London gates,,,
And loud the sea-kings in the cloud,,,
Broke through their dreaming gods, and loud,,
Cried on their dreadful Fates.,,,
,,,
And all the while on White Horse Hill,,,
The horse lay long and wan,,,
The turf crawled and the fungus crept,,,
And the little sorrel, while all men slept,,
Unwrought the work of man.,,,
,,,
With velvet finger, velvet foot,,
The fierce soft mosses then,,,
Crept on the large white commonweal,,,
All folk had striven to strip and peel,,,
And the grass, like a great green witch's wheel,,
Unwound the toils of men.,,,
,,,
And clover and silent thistle throve,,,
And buds burst silently,,,
With little care for the Thames Valley,,,
Or what things there might be--,,,
,,,
That away on the widening river,,,
In the eastern plains for crown,,,
Stood up in the pale purple sky,,,
One turret of smoke like ivory;,,,
And the smoke changed and the wind went by,,,
"And the King took London Town.""",Ballad,,
41,John Davidson,"'A letter from my love to-day!
Oh, unexpected, dear appeal!'
She struck a happy tear away,
And broke the crimson seal.

'My love, there is no help on earth,
No help in heaven; the dead-man's bell
Must toll our wedding; our first hearth
Must be the well-paved floor of hell.'

The colour died from out her face,
Her eyes like ghostly candles shone;
She cast dread looks about the place,
Then clenched her teeth and read right on.

'I may not pass the prison door;
Here must I rot from day to day,
Unless I wed whom I abhor,
My cousin, Blanche of Valencay.

'At midnight with my dagger keen,
I'll take my life; it must be so.
Meet me in hell to-night, my queen,
For weal and woe.'

She laughed although her face was wan,
She girded on her golden belt,
She took her jewelled ivory fan,
And at her glowing missal knelt.

Then rose, 'And am I mad?' she said:
She broke her fan, her belt untied;
With leather girt herself instead,
And stuck a dagger at her side.

She waited, shuddering in her room,
Till sleep had fallen on all the house.
She never flinched; she faced her doom:
They two must sin to keep their vows.

Then out into the night she went,
And, stooping, crept by hedge and tree;
Her rose-bush flung a snare of scent,
And caught a happy memory.

She fell, and lay a minute's space;
She tore the sward in her distress;
The dewy grass refreshed her face;
She rose and ran with lifted dress.

She started like a morn-caught ghost
Once when the moon came out and stood
To watch; the naked road she crossed,
And dived into the murmuring wood.

The branches snatched her streaming cloak;
A live thing shrieked; she made no stay!
She hurried to the trysting-oak—
Right well she knew the way.

Without a pause she bared her breast,
And drove her dagger home and fell,
And lay like one that takes her rest,
And died and wakened up in hell.

She bathed her spirit in the flame,
And near the centre took her post;
From all sides to her ears there came
The dreary anguish of the lost.

The devil started at her side,
Comely, and tall, and black as jet.
'I am young Malespina's bride;
Has he come hither yet?'

'My poppet, welcome to your bed.'
'Is Malespina here?'
'Not he! To-morrow he must wed
His cousin Blanche, my dear!'

'You lie, he died with me to-night.'
'Not he! it was a plot' ... 'You lie.'
'My dear, I never lie outright.'
'We died at midnight, he and I.'

The devil went. Without a groan
She, gathered up in one fierce prayer,
Took root in hell's midst all alone,
And waited for him there.

She dared to make herself at home
Amidst the wail, the uneasy stir.
The blood-stained flame that filled the dome,
Scentless and silent, shrouded her.

How long she stayed I cannot tell;
But when she felt his perfidy,
She marched across the floor of hell;
And all the damned stood up to see.

The devil stopped her at the brink:
She shook him off; she cried, 'Away!'
'My dear, you have gone mad, I think.'
'I was betrayed: I will not stay.'

Across the weltering deep she ran;
A stranger thing was never seen:
The damned stood silent to a man;
They saw the great gulf set between.

To her it seemed a meadow fair;
And flowers sprang up about her feet
She entered heaven; she climbed the stair
And knelt down at the mercy-seat.

Seraphs and saints with one great voice
Welcomed that soul that knew not fear.
Amazed to find it could rejoice,
Hell raised a hoarse, half-human cheer.",Ballad
42,Franklin Pierce Adams,"The burden of hard hitting. Slug away 
Like Honus Wagner or like Tyrus Cobb. 
Else fandom shouteth: ""Who said you could play? 
Back to the jasper league, you minor slob!"" 
Swat, hit, connect, line out, goet on the job. 
Else you shall feel the brunt of fandom's ire 
Biff, bang it, clout it, hit it on the knob - 
This is the end of every fan's desire. 

The burden of good pitching. Curved or straight. 
Or in or out, or haply up or down, 
To puzzle him that standeth by the plate, 
To lessen, so to speak, his bat-renown: 
Like Christy Mathewson or Miner Brown, 
So pitch that every man can but admire 
And offer you the freedom of the town - 
This is the end of every fan's desire. 

The burden of loud cheering. O the sounds! 
The tumult and the shouting from the throats 
Of forty thousand at the Polo Grounds 
Sitting, ay, standing sans their hats and coats. 
A mighty cheer that possibly denotes 
That Cub or Pirate fat is in the fire; 
Or, as H. James would say, We've got their goats - 
This is the end of every fan's desire. 

The burden of a pennant. O the hope, 
The tenuous hope, the hope that's half a fear, 
The lengthy season and the boundless dope, 
And the bromidic, ""Wait until next year."" 
O dread disgrace of trailing in the rear, 
O Piece of Bunting, flying high and higher 
That next October it shall flutter here: 
This is the end of every fan's desire. 

ENVOY 

Ah, Fans, let not the Quarry but the Chase 
Be that to which most fondly we aspire! 
For us not Stake, but Game; not Goal, but Race - 

THIS is the end of every fan's desire.",Ballad
43,Algernon Charles Swinburne,"A Ballad of Burdens 

          The burden of fair women. Vain delight,
             And love self-slain in some sweet shameful way,
          And sorrowful old age that comes by night
             As a thief comes that has no heart by day,
             And change that finds fair cheeks and leaves them grey,
          And weariness that keeps awake for hire,
             And grief that says what pleasure used to say;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of bought kisses. This is sore,
             A burden without fruit in childbearing;
          Between the nightfall and the dawn threescore,
             Threescore between the dawn and evening.
             The shuddering in thy lips, the shuddering
          In thy sad eyelids tremulous like fire,
             Makes love seem shameful and a wretched thing.
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of sweet speeches. Nay, kneel down,
             Cover thy head, and weep; for verily
          These market-men that buy thy white and brown
             In the last days shall take no thought for thee.
             In the last days like earth thy face shall be,
          Yea, like sea-marsh made thick with brine and mire,
             Sad with sick leavings of the sterile sea.
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of long living. Thou shalt fear
             Waking, and sleeping mourn upon thy bed;
          And say at night ""Would God the day were here,""
             And say at dawn ""Would God the day were dead.""
             With weary days thou shalt be clothed and fed,
          And wear remorse of heart for thine attire,
             Pain for thy girdle and sorrow upon thine head;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of bright colours. Thou shalt see
             Gold tarnished, and the grey above the green;
          And as the thing thou seest thy face shall be,
             And no more as the thing beforetime seen.
             And thou shalt say of mercy ""It hath been,""
          And living, watch the old lips and loves expire,
             And talking, tears shall take thy breath between;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of sad sayings. In that day
             Thou shalt tell all thy days and hours, and tell
          Thy times and ways and words of love, and say
             How one was dear and one desirable,
             And sweet was life to hear and sweet to smell,
          But now with lights reverse the old hours retire
             And the last hour is shod with fire from hell;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of four seasons. Rain in spring,
             White rain and wind among the tender trees;
          A summer of green sorrows gathering,
             Rank autumn in a mist of miseries,
             With sad face set towards the year, that sees
          The charred ash drop out of the dropping pyre,
             And winter wan with many maladies;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of dead faces. Out of sight
             And out of love, beyond the reach of hands,
          Changed in the changing of the dark and light,
             They walk and weep about the barren lands
             Where no seed is nor any garner stands,
          Where in short breaths the doubtful days respire,
             And time's turned glass lets through the sighing sands;
          This is the end of every man's desire. 

          The burden of much gladness. Life and lust
             Forsake thee, and the face of thy delight;
          And underfoot the heavy hour strews dust,
             And overhead strange weathers burn and bite;
             And where the red was, lo the bloodless white,
          And where the truth was, the likeness of a liar,
             And where the day was, the likeness of the night;
          This is the end of every man's desire.

44,Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,"OH, enter old minstrel, thou time-honour'd one!
We children are here in the hall all alone,

The portals we straightway will bar.
Our mother is praying, our father is gone

To the forest, on wolves to make war.
Oh sing us a ballad, the tale then repeat,

'Till brother and I learn it right;
We long have been hoping a minstrel to meet,

For children hear tales with delight.

""At midnight, when darkness its fearful veil weaves,
His lofty and stately old castle he leaves,

But first he has buried his wealth.
What figure is that in his arms one perceives,

As the Count quits the gateway by stealth?
O'er what is his mantle so hastily thrown?

What bears he along in his flight?
A daughter it is, and she gently sleeps on""--

The children they hear with delight.

""The morning soon glimmers. the world is so wide,
In valleys and forests a home is supplied,

The bard in each village is cheer'd.
Thus lives he and wanders, while years onward glide,

And longer still waxes his beard;
But the maiden so fair in his arms grows amain,

'Neath her star all-protecting and bright,
Secured in the mantle from wind and from rain--""

The children they hear with delight.

""And year upon year with swift footstep now steals,
The mantle it fades, many rents it reveals,

The maiden no more it can hold.
The father he sees her, what rapture he feels!

His joy cannot now be controll'd.
How worthy she seems of the race whence she springs,

How noble and fair to the sight!
What wealth to her dearly-loved father she brings!""--

The children they hear with delight.

""Then comes there a princely knight galloping by,
She stretches her hand out, as soon as he's nigh,

But alms he refuses to give.
He seizes her hand, with a smile in his eye:

'Thou art mine!' he exclaims, 'while I live!'
'When thou know'st,' cries the old man, 'the treasure that's
there,

A princess thou'lt make her of right;
Betroth'd be she now, on this spot green and fair--'""

The children they hear with delight.

""So she's bless'd by the priest on the hallowed place,
And she goes with a smiling but sorrowful face,

From her father she fain would not part.
The old man still wanders with ne'er-changing pace,

He covers with joy his sad heart.
So I think of my daughter, as years pass away,

And my grandchildren far from my sight;
I bless them by night, and I bless them by day""--

The children they hear with delight.

He blesses the children: a knocking they hear,
The father it is! They spring forward in fear,

The old man they cannot conceal--
""Thou beggar, wouldst lure, then, my children so dear?

Straight seize him, ye vassals of steel!
To the dungeon most deep, with the fool-hardy knave!""

The mother from far hears the fight;
She hastens with flatt'ring entreaty to crave--

The children they hear with delight.

The vassals they suffer the Bard to stand there,
And mother and children implore him to spare,

The proud prince would stifle his ire,
'Till driven to fury at hearing their prayer,

His smouldering anger takes fire:
""Thou pitiful race! Oh, thou beggarly crew!

Eclipsing my star, once so bright!
Ye'll bring me destruction, ye sorely shall rue!""

The children they hear with affright.

The old man still stands there with dignified mien,
The vassals of steel quake before him, I ween,

The Count's fury increases in power;
""My wedded existence a curse long has been,

And these are the fruits from that flower!
'Tis ever denied, and the saying is true,

That to wed with the base-born is right;
The beggar has borne me a beggarly crew,--""

The children they hear with affright.

""If the husband, the father, thus treats you with scorn,
If the holiest bonds by him rashly are torn,

Then come to your father--to me!
The beggar may gladden life's pathway forlorn,

Though aged and weak he may be.
This castle is mine! thou hast made it thy prey,

Thy people 'twas put me to flight;
The tokens I bear will confirm what I say""--

The children they hear with delight.

""The king who erst govern'd returneth again,
And restores to the Faithful the goods that were ta'en,

I'll unseal all my treasures the while;
The laws shall be gentle, and peaceful the reign""--

The old man thus cries with a smile--
""Take courage, my son! all hath turned out for good,

And each hath a star that is bright,
Those the princess hath borne thee are princely in blood,""--

The children thy hear with delight.",Ballad
45,Anne Sexton,"The end of the affair is always death. 
She's my workshop. Slippery eye, 
out of the tribe of myself my breath 
finds you gone. I horrify 
those who stand by. I am fed. 
At night, alone, I marry the bed. 
Finger to finger, now she's mine. 
She's not too far. She's my encounter. 
I beat her like a bell. I recline 
in the bower where you used to mount her. 
You borrowed me on the flowered spread. 
At night, alone, I marry the bed. 
Take for instance this night, my love, 
that every single couple puts together 
with a joint overturning, beneath, above, 
the abundant two on sponge and feather, 
kneeling and pushing, head to head. 
At night, alone, I marry the bed. 
I break out of my body this way, 
an annoying miracle. Could I 
put the dream market on display? 
I am spread out. I crucify. 
My little plum is what you said. 
At night, alone, I marry the bed. 
Then my black-eyed rival came. 
The lady of water, rising on the beach, 
a piano at her fingertips, shame 
on her lips and a flute's speech. 
And I was the knock-kneed broom instead. 
At night, alone, I marry the bed. 
She took you the way a women takes 
a bargain dress off the rack 
and I broke the way a stone breaks. 
I give back your books and fishing tack. 
Today's paper says that you are wed. 
At night, alone, I marry the bed. 
The boys and girls are one tonight. 
They unbutton blouses. They unzip flies. 
They take off shoes. They turn off the light. 
The glimmering creatures are full of lies. 
They are eating each other. They are overfed. 
At night, alone, I marry the bed.",Ballad
46,Henry Lawson,"Across the stony ridges, 
 Across the rolling plain, 
Young Harry Dale, the drover, 
 Comes riding home again. 
And well his stock-horse bears him, 
 And light of heart is he, 
And stoutly his old pack-horse 
 Is trotting by his knee. 
 
Up Queensland way with cattle 
 He travelled regions vast; 
And many months have vanished 
 Since home-folk saw him last. 
He hums a song of someone 
 He hopes to marry soon; 
And hobble-chains and camp-ware 
 Keep jingling to the tune. 
 
Beyond the hazy dado 
 Against the lower skies 
And yon blue line of ranges 
 The homestead station lies. 
And thitherward the drover 
 Jogs through the lazy noon, 
While hobble-chains and camp-ware 
 Are jingling to a tune. 
 
An hour has filled the heavens 
 With storm-clouds inky black; 
At times the lightning trickles 
 Around the drover's track; 
But Harry pushes onward, 
 His horses' strength he tries, 
In hope to reach the river 
 Before the flood shall rise. 
 
The thunder from above him 
 Goes rolling o'er the plain; 
And down on thirsty pastures 
 In torrents falls the rain. 
And every creek and gully 
 Sends forth its little flood, 
Till the river runs a banker, 
 All stained with yellow mud. 
 
Now Harry speaks to Rover, 
 The best dog on the plains, 
And to his hardy horses, 
 And strokes their shaggy manes; 
`We've breasted bigger rivers 
 When floods were at their height 
Nor shall this gutter stop us 
 From getting home to-night!' 
 
The thunder growls a warning, 
 The ghastly lightnings gleam, 
As the drover turns his horses 
 To swim the fatal stream. 
But, oh! the flood runs stronger 
 Than e'er it ran before; 
The saddle-horse is failing, 
 And only half-way o'er! 
 
When flashes next the lightning, 
 The flood's grey breast is blank, 
And a cattle dog and pack-horse 
 Are struggling up the bank. 
But in the lonely homestead 
 The girl will wait in vain -- 
He'll never pass the stations 
 In charge of stock again. 
 
The faithful dog a moment 
 Sits panting on the bank, 
And then swims through the current 
 To where his master sank. 
And round and round in circles 
 He fights with failing strength, 
Till, borne down by the waters, 
 The old dog sinks at length. 
 
Across the flooded lowlands 
 And slopes of sodden loam 
The pack-horse struggles onward, 
 To take dumb tidings home. 
And mud-stained, wet, and weary, 
 Through ranges dark goes he; 
While hobble-chains and tinware 
 Are sounding eerily. 
 
     .    .    .    .    . 
 
The floods are in the ocean, 
 The stream is clear again, 
And now a verdant carpet 
 Is stretched across the plain. 
But someone's eyes are saddened, 
 And someone's heart still bleeds 
In sorrow for the drover 
 Who sleeps among the reeds.",Ballad

When by the labor of my 'ands
I've 'elped to pack a transport tight 
With prisoners for foreign lands, 
I ain't transported with delight.
I know it's only just an' right,
But yet it somehow sickens me,
For I 'ave learned at Waterval

Beneath the tall electric light,

48,Sir Henry Newbolt,"It fell in the year of Mutiny, 
At darkest of the night, 
John Nicholson by Jalándhar came, 
On his way to Delhi fight. 

And as he by Jalándhar came, 
He thought what he must do, 
And he sent to the Rajah fair greeting, 
To try if he were true. 

""God grant your Highness length of days, 
And friends when need shall be; 
And I pray you send your Captains hither, 
That they may speak with me."" 

On the morrow through Jalándhar town 
The Captains rode in state; 
They came to the house of John Nicholson, 
And stood before the gate. 

The chief of them was Mehtab Singh, 
He was both proud and sly; 
His turban gleamed with rubies red, 
He held his chin full high. 

He marked his fellows how they put 
Their shoes from off their feet; 
""Now wherefore make ye such ado 
These fallen lords to greet? 

""They have ruled us for a hundred years, 
In truth I know not how, 
But though they be fain of mastery 
They dare not claim it now."" 

Right haughtily before them all 
The durbar hall he trod, 
With rubies red his turban gleamed, 
His feet with pride were shod. 

They had not been an hour together, 
A scanty hour or so, 
When Mehtab Singh rose in his place 
And turned about to go. 

Then swiftly came John Nicholson 
Between the door and him, 
With anger smouldering in his eyes, 
That made the rubies dim. 

""You are over-hasty, Mehtab Singh,"" -- 
Oh, but his voice was low! 
He held his wrath with a curb of iron 
That furrowed cheek and brow. 

""You are over-hasty, Mehtab Singh, 
When that the rest are gone, 
I have a word that may not wait 
To speak with you alone."" 

The Captains passed in silence forth 
And stood the door behind; 
To go before the game was played 
Be sure they had no mind. 

But there within John Nicholson 
Turned him on Mehtab Singh, 
""So long as the soul is in my body 
You shall not do this thing. 

""Have ye served us for a hundred years 
And yet ye know not why? 
We brook no doubt of our mastery, 
We rule until we die. 

""Were I the one last Englishman 
Drawing the breath of life, 
And you the master-rebel of all 
That stir this land to strife -- 

""Were I,"" he said, ""but a Corporal, 
And you a Rajput King, 
So long as the soul was in my body 
You should not do this thing. 

""Take off, take off, those shoes of pride, 
Carry them whence they came; 
Your Captains saw your insolence, 
And they shall see your shame."" 

When Mehtab Singh came to the door 
His shoes they burned his hand, 
For there in long and silent lines 
He saw the Captains stand. 

When Mehtab Singh rode from the gate 
His chin was on his breast: 
The captains said, ""When the strong command 
Obedience is best.""",Ballad
49,William Butler Yeats,"'Lay me in a cushioned chair;
Carry me, ye four,
With cushions here and cushions there,
To see the world once more.

'To stable and to kennel go;
Bring what is there to bring;
Lead my Lollard to and fro,
Or gently in a ring.

'Put the chair upon the grass:
Bring Rody and his hounds,
That I may contented pass
From these earthly bounds.'

His eyelids droop, his head falls low,
His old eyes cloud with dreams;
The sun upon all things that grow
Falls in sleepy streams.

Brown Lollard treads upon the lawn,
And to the armchair goes,
And now the old man's dreams are gone,
He smooths the long brown nose.

And now moves many a pleasant tongue
Upon his wasted hands,
For leading aged hounds and young
The huntsman near him stands.

'Huntsmam Rody, blow the horn,
Make the hills reply.'
The huntsman loosens on the morn
A gay wandering cry.

Fire is in the old man's eyes,
His fingers move and sway,
And when the wandering music dies
They hear him feebly say,

'Huntsman Rody, blow the horn,
Make the hills reply.'
'I cannot blow upon my horn,
I can but weep and sigh.'

Servants round his cushioned place
Are with new sorrow wrung;
Hounds are gazing on his face,
Aged hounds and young.

One blind hound only lies apart
On the sun-smitten grass;
He holds deep commune with his heart:
The moments pass and pass:

The blind hound with a mournful din
Lifts slow his wintry head;
The servants bear the body in;
The hounds wail for the dead.",Ballad

About the bush did jog. 
Till, passing by a settler's hut, 
He stopped and bought a dog. 
Then started homewards full of hope, 
Alas, that hopes should fail! 
The dog pulled back and took the rope 
Beneath the horse's tail. 

The Horse remarked, ""I would be soft 
Such liberties to stand!"" 
""Oh dog,"" he said, ""Go up aloft,

51,William Butler Yeats,"COME round me, little childer;
There, don't fling stones at me
Because I mutter as I go;
But pity Moll Magee.
My man was a poor fisher
With shore lines in the say;
My work was saltin' herrings
The whole of the long day.
And sometimes from the Saltin' shed
I scarce could drag my feet,
Under the blessed moonlight,
Along thc pebbly street.
I'd always been but weakly,
And my baby was just born;
A neighbour minded her by day,
I minded her till morn.
I lay upon my baby;
Ye little childer dear,
I looked on my cold baby
When the morn grew frosty and clear.
A weary woman sleeps so hard!
My man grew red and pale,
And gave me money, and bade me go
To my own place, Kinsale.
He drove me out and shut the door.
And gave his curse to me;
I went away in silence,
No neighbour could I see.
The windows and the doors were shut,
One star shone faint and green,
The little straws were turnin round
Across the bare boreen.
I went away in silence:
Beyond old Martin's byre
I saw a kindly neighbour
Blowin' her mornin' fire.
She drew from me my story --
My money's all used up,
And still, with pityin', scornin' eye,
She gives me bite and sup.
She says my man will surely come
And fetch me home agin;
But always, as I'm movin' round,
Without doors or within,
Pilin' the wood or pilin' the turf,
Or goin' to the well,
I'm thinkin' of my baby
And keenin' to mysel'.
And Sometimes I am sure she knows
When, openin' wide His door,
God lights the stats, His candles,
And looks upon the poor.
So now, ye little childer,
Ye won't fling stones at me;
But gather with your shinin' looks
And pity Moll Magee.",Ballad
52,Robert Southey,"High on a rock, whose castled shade
 Darken'd the lake below,
In ancient strength majestic stood
 The towers of Arlinkow.

The fisher in the lake below
 Durst never cast his net,
Nor ever swallow in its waves
 Her passing wings would wet.

The cattle from its ominous banks
 In wild alarm would run,
Tho' parched with thirst and faint beneath
 The summer's scorching sun.

For sometimes when no passing breeze
 The long lank sedges waved,
All white with foam and heaving high
 Its deafening billows raved;

And when the tempest from its base
 The rooted pine would shake,
The powerless storm unruffling swept
 Across the calm dead lake.

And ever then when Death drew near
 The house of Arlinkow,
Its dark unfathom'd depths did send
 Strange music from below.

The Lord of Arlinkow was old,
 One only child had he,
Donica was the Maiden's name
 As fair as fair might be.

A bloom as bright as opening morn
 Flush'd o'er her clear white cheek,
The music of her voice was mild,
 Her full dark eyes were meek.

Far was her beauty known, for none
 So fair could Finland boast,
Her parents loved the Maiden much,
 Young EBERHARD loved her most.

Together did they hope to tread
 The pleasant path of life,
For now the day drew near to make
 Donica Eberhard's wife.

The eve was fair and mild the air,
 Along the lake they stray;
The eastern hill reflected bright
 The fading tints of day.

And brightly o'er the water stream'd
 The liquid radiance wide;
Donica's little dog ran on
 And gambol'd at her side.

Youth, Health, and Love bloom'd on her cheek,
 Her full dark eyes express
In many a glance to Eberhard
 Her soul's meek tenderness.

Nor sound was heard, nor passing gale
 Sigh'd thro' the long lank sedge,
The air was hushed, no little wave
 Dimpled the water's edge.

Sudden the unfathom'd lake sent forth
 Strange music from beneath,
And slowly o'er the waters sail'd
 The solemn sounds of Death.

As the deep sounds of Death arose,
 Donica's cheek grew pale,
And in the arms of Eberhard
 The senseless Maiden fell.

Loudly the youth in terror shriek'd,
 And loud he call'd for aid,
And with a wild and eager look
 Gaz'd on the death-pale Maid.

But soon again did better thoughts
 In Eberhard arise,
And he with trembling hope beheld
 The Maiden raise her eyes.

And on his arm reclin'd she moved
 With feeble pace and slow,
And soon with strength recover'd reach'd

Yet never to Donica's cheek
 Return'd the lively hue,
Her cheeks were deathy, white, and wan,
 Her lips a livid blue.

Her eyes so bright and black of yore
 Were now more black and bright,
And beam'd strange lustre in her face
 So deadly wan and white.

The dog that gambol'd by her side,
 And lov'd with her to stray,
Now at his alter'd mistress howl'd
 And fled in fear away.

Yet did the faithful Eberhard
 Not love the Maid the less;
He gaz'd with sorrow, but he gaz'd
 With deeper tenderness.

And when he found her health unharm'd
 He would not brook delay,
But press'd the not unwilling Maid
 To fix the bridal day.

And when at length it came, with joy
 They hail'd the bridal day,
And onward to the house of God
 They went their willing way.

And as they at the altar stood
 And heard the sacred rite,
The hallowed tapers dimly stream'd
 A pale sulphureous light.

And as the Youth with holy warmth
 Her hand in his did hold,
Sudden he felt Donica's hand
 Grow deadly damp and cold.

And loudly did he shriek, for lo!
 A Spirit met his view,
And Eberhard in the angel form
 His own Donica knew.

That instant from her earthly frame
 Howling the Daemon fled,
And at the side of Eberhard
 The livid form fell dead.",Ballad
53,William Butler Yeats,"GOOD Father John O'Hart
In penal days rode out
To a Shoneen who had free lands
And his own snipe and trout.
In trust took he John's lands;
Sleiveens were all his race;
And he gave them as dowers to his daughters.
And they married beyond their place.
But Father John went up,
And Father John went down;
And he wore small holes in his Shoes,
And he wore large holes in his gown.
All loved him, only the shoneen,
Whom the devils have by the hair,
From the wives, and the cats, and the children,
To the birds in the white of the air.
The birds, for he opened their cages
As he went up and down;
And he said with a smile, 'Have peace now';
And he went his way with a frown.
But if when anyone died
Came keeners hoarser than rooks,
He bade them give over their keening;
For he was a man of books.
And these were the works of John,
When, weeping score by score,
People came into Colooney;
For he'd died at ninety-four.
There was no human keening;
The birds from Knocknarea
And the world round Knocknashee
Came keening in that day.
The young birds and old birds
Came flying, heavy and sad;
Keening in from Tiraragh,
Keening from Ballinafad;
Keening from Inishmurray.
Nor stayed for bite or sup;
This way were all reproved
Who dig old customs up.",Ballad
54,Zbigniew Herbert,"Those who sailed at dawn
but will never return
left their trace on a wave--

beautiful as lips turned to stone

but could not reach the shuttered windows
though they already saw the roofs--

they have found shelter in a bell of air

but those who leave behind only
a room grown cold a few books
an empty inkwell white paper--

in truth they have not completely died
their whisper travels through thickets of wallpaper
their level head still lives in the ceiling

their paradise was made of air
of water lime and earth an angel of wind
will pulverize the body in its hand
they will be
carried over the meadows of this world",Ballad
55,John Gay,"1       All in the Downs the fleet was moor'd,
2         The streamers waving in the wind,
3     When black-ey'd Susan came aboard.
4         Oh! where shall I my true love find!
5     Tell me, ye jovial sailors, tell me true,
6     If my sweet William sails among the crew.

7       William, who high upon the yard,
8         Rock'd with the billow to and fro,
9     Soon as her well-known voice he heard,
10       He sigh'd, and cast his eyes below:
11   The cord slides swiftly through his glowing hands,
12   And, (quick as lightning) on the deck he stands.

13     So the sweet lark, high pois'd in air,
14       Shuts close his pinions to his breast,
15   (If, chance, his mate's shrill call he hear)
16       And drops at once into her nest.
17   The noblest captain in the British fleet,
18   Might envy William's lip those kisses sweet.

20       My vows shall ever true remain;
21   Let me kiss off that falling tear,
22       We only part to meet again.
23   Change, as ye list, ye winds; my heart shall be
24   The faithful compass that still points to thee.

25     'Believe not what the landmen say,
26       Who tempt with doubts thy constant mind:
27   They'll tell thee, sailors, when away,
28       In ev'ry port a mistress find.
29   Yes, yes, believe them when they tell thee so,
30   For thou art present wheresoe'er I go.

32       Thy eyes are seen in di'monds bright,
33   Thy breath is Afric's spicy gale,
34       Thy skin is ivory, so white.
35   Thus ev'ry beauteous object that I view,

56,Rudyard Kipling,"'T was Fultah Fisher's boarding-house,
Where sailor-men reside,
And there were men of all the ports
From Mississip to Clyde,
And regally they spat and smoked,
And fearsomely they lied.

They lied about the purple Sea
That gave them scanty bread,
They lied about the Earth beneath,
The Heavens overhead,
For they had looked too often on
Black rum when that was red.

They told their tales of wreck and wrong,
Of shame and lust and fraud,
They backed their toughest statements with
The Brimstone of the Lord,
And crackling oaths went to and fro
Across the fist-banged board.

And there was Hans the blue-eyed Dane,
Bull-throated, bare of arm,
Who carried on his hairy chest
The maid Ultruda's charm --
The little silver crucifix
That keeps a man from harm.

And there was Jake Without-the-Ears,
And Pamba the Malay,
And Carboy Gin the Guinea cook,
And Luz from Vigo Bay,
And Honest Jack who sold them slops
And harvested their pay.

And there was Salem Hardieker,
A lean Bostonian he --
Russ, German, English, Halfbreed, Finn,
Yank, Dane, and Portugee,
At Fultah Fisher's boarding-house
They rested from the sea.

Now Anne of Austria shared their drinks,
Collinga knew her fame,
From Tarnau in Galicia
To Juan Bazaar she came,
To eat the bread of infamy
And take the wage of shame.

She held a dozen men to heel --
Rich spoil of war was hers,
In hose and gown and ring and chain,
From twenty mariners,
And, by Port Law, that week, men called
Her Salem Hardieker's.

But seamen learnt -- what landsmen know --
That neither gifts nor gain
Can hold a winking Light o' Love
Or Fancy's flight restrain,
When Anne of Austria rolled her eyes
On Hans the blue-eyed Dane.

Since Life is strife, and strife means knife,
From Howrah to the Bay,
And he may die before the dawn
Who liquored out the day,
In Fultah Fisher's boarding-house
We woo while yet we may.

But cold was Hans the blue-eyed Dane,
Bull-throated, bare of arm,
And laughter shook the chest beneath
The maid Ultruda's charm --
The little silver crucifix
That keeps a man from harm.

""You speak to Salem Hardieker;
""You was his girl, I know.
""I ship mineselfs to-morrow, see,
""Und round the Skaw we go,
""South, down the Cattegat, by Hjelm,
""To Besser in Saro.""

When love rejected turns to hate,
All ill betide the man.
""You speak to Salem Hardieker"" --
She spoke as woman can.
A scream -- a sob -- ""He called me -- names!""
And then the fray began.

An oath from Salem Hardieker,
A shriek upon the stairs,
A dance of shadows on the wall,
A knife-thrust unawares --
And Hans came down, as cattle drop,
Across the broken chairs.

. . . . . .

In Anne of Austria's trembling hands
The weary head fell low: --
""I ship mineselfs to-morrow, straight
""For Besser in Saro;
""Und there Ultruda comes to me
""At Easter, und I go

""South, down the Cattegat -- What's here?
""There -- are -- no -- lights -- to guide!""
The mutter ceased, the spirit passed,
And Anne of Austria cried
In Fultah Fisher's boarding-house
When Hans the mighty died.

Thus slew they Hans the blue-eyed Dane,
Bull-throated, bare of arm,
But Anne of Austria looted first
The maid Ultruda's charm --
The little silver crucifix
That keeps a man from harm.",Ballad
57,Ellis Parker Butler,"Listen, ladies, while I sing
The ballad of John Henry King.

John Henry was a bachelor,
His age was thirty-three or four.

Two maids for his affection vied,
And each desired to be his bride,

And bravely did they strive to bring
Unto their feet John Henry King.

John Henry liked them both so well,
To save his life he could not tell

Which he most wished to be his bride,
Nor was he able to decide.

Fair Kate was jolly, bright, and gay,
And sunny as a summer day;

Marie was kind, sedate, and sweet,
With gentle ways and manners neat.

Each was so dear that John confessed
He could not tell which he liked best.

He studied them for quite a year,
And still found no solution near,

And might have studied two years more
Had he not, walking on the shore,

Conceived a very simple way
Of ending his prolonged delay--

A way in which he might decide
Which of the maids should be his bride.

He said, ""I'll toss into the air
A dollar, and I'll toss it fair;

If heads come up, I'll wed Marie;
If tails, fair Kate my bride shall be.""

Then from his leather pocket-book
A dollar bright and new he took;

He kissed one side for fair Marie,
The other side for Kate kissed he.

Then in a manner free and fair
He tossed the dollar in the air.

""Ye fates,"" he cried, ""pray let this be
A lucky throw indeed for me!""

The dollar rose, the dollar fell;
He watched its whirling transit well,

And off some twenty yards or more
The dollar fell upon the shore.

John Henry ran to where it struck
To see which maiden was in luck.

But, oh, the irony of fate!
Upon its edge the coin stood straight!

And there, embedded in the sand,
John Henry let the dollar stand!

And he will tempt his fate no more,
But live and die a bachelor.

Thus, ladies, you have heard me sing
The ballad of John Henry King.

58,Dante Gabriel Rossetti,"Tell me now in what hidden way is 
Lady Flora the lovely Roman? 
Where's Hipparchia, and where is Thais, 
Neither of them the fairer woman? 
Where is Echo, beheld of no man,

She whose beauty was more than human?-- 
But where are the snows of yester-year? 

Where's Heloise, the learned nun, 
For whose sake Abeillard, I ween, 
Lost manhood and put priesthood on?

Sewed in a sack's mouth down the Seine?--

 Hid away in an oaken chest,

 Beareth Amandy Baker's crest;

 Or Dorcas Eastman prone to invest
In Cupid's bonds, they could find their fate
 In the bootless bard of Crockery Quest.

60,Michael Drayton,"Fair stood the wind for France,
   When we our sails advance;
   Nor now to prove our chance
       Longer will tarry;
   But putting to the main,
   At Caux, the mouth of Seine,
   With all his martial train
       Landed King Harry.

   And taking many a fort,
  Furnish'd in warlike sort,
  Marcheth towards Agincourt
      In happy hour;
  Skirmishing day by day
  With those that stopp'd his way,
  Where the French gen'ral lay
      With all his power.

  Which, in his height of pride,
  King Henry to deride,
  His ransom to provide
      To the King sending;
  Which he neglects the while,
  As from a nation vile
  Yet with an angry smile
      Their fall portending.

  And turning to his men
  Quoth our brave Henry then:
  ""Though they to one be ten
      Be not amazed.
  Yet have we well begun:
  Battles so bravely won
  Have ever to the sun
      By Fame been raised!

  ""And for myself,"" quoth he,
  ""This my full rest shall be:
  England ne'er mourn for me,
      Nor more esteem me;
  Victor I will remain,
  Or on this earth lie slain;
  Never shall she sustain
      Loss to redeem me!

  ""Poitiers and Cressy tell
  When most their pride did swell
  Under our swords they fell;
      No less our skill is
  Than when our grandsire great,
  Claiming the regal seat,
  By many a warlike feat
      Lopp'd the French lilies.""

  The Duke of York so dread
  The eager vaward led;
  With the main Henry sped
      Amongst his henchmen:
  Excester had the rear,
  A braver man not there
  O Lord, how hot they were
      On the false Frenchmen!

  They now to fight are gone;
  Armour on armour shone;
  Drum now to drum did groan:
       To hear, was wonder;
  That, with cries they make,
  The very earth did shake;
  Trumpet to trumpet spake,
      Thunder to thunder.

  Well it thine age became,
  O noble Erpingham,
  Which didst the signal aim
      To our hid forces;
  When, from a meadow by,
  Like a storm suddenly,
  The English archery
      Stuck the French horses

  With Spanish yew so strong,
  Arrows a cloth-yard long,
  That like to serpents stung,
      Piercing the weather.
  None from his fellow starts,
  But playing manly parts,
  And like true English hearts
      Stuck close together.

  When down their bows they threw,
  And forth their bilboes drew,
  And on the French they flew,
      Not one was tardy;
  Arms were from shoulders sent,
  Scalps to the teeth were rent,
  Down the French peasants went:
      Our men were hardy.

  This while our noble King,
  His broad sword brandishing,
  Down the French host did ding,
      As to o'erwhelm it.
  And many a deep wound lent,
  His arms with blood besprent,
  And many a cruel dent
      Bruised his helmet.

  Gloster, that duke so good,
  Next of the royal blood,
  For famous England stood
    With his brave brother.
 Clarence, in steel so bright,
 Though but a maiden knight,
 Yet in that furious fight
    Scarce such another!

 Warwick in blood did wade,
 Oxford the foe invade,
 And cruel slaughter made,
    Still as they ran up.
 Suffolk his axe did ply;
 Beaumont and Willoughby
 Bare them right doughtily;
    Ferrers and Fanhope.

 Upon Saint Crispin's Day
 Fought was this noble fray,
 Which fame did not delay
    To England to carry.
 O when shall English men
 With such acts fill a pen,
 Or England breed again

61,Algernon Charles Swinburne,"Bird of the bitter bright grey golden morn 
Scarce risen upon the dusk of dolorous years, 
First of us all and sweetest singer born 
Whose far shrill note the world of new men hears 
Cleave the cold shuddering shade as twilight clears; 
When song new-born put off the old world's attire 
And felt its tune on her changed lips expire, 
Writ foremost on the roll of them that came 
Fresh girt for service of the latter lyre, 
Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name! 


Alas the joy, the sorrow, and the scorn, 
That clothed thy life with hopes and sins and fears, 
And gave thee stones for bread and tares for corn 
And plume-plucked gaol-birds for thy starveling peers 
Till death clipt close their flight with shameful shears; 
Till shifts came short and loves were hard to hire, 
When lilt of song nor twitch of twangling wire 
Could buy thee bread or kisses; when light fame 
Spurned like a ball and haled through brake and briar, 
Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name! 


Poor splendid wings so frayed and soiled and torn! 
Poor kind wild eyes so dashed with light quick tears! 
Poor perfect voice, most blithe when most forlorn, 
That rings athwart the sea whence no man steers 
Like joy-bells crossed with death-bells in our ears! 
What far delight has cooled the fierce desire 
That like some ravenous bird was strong to tire 
On that frail flesh and soul consumed with flame, 
But left more sweet than roses to respire, 
Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name? 


Prince of sweet songs made out of tears and fire, 
A harlot was thy nurse, a God thy sire; 
Shame soiled thy song, and song assoiled thy shame. 
But from thy feet now death has washed the mire, 
Love reads out first at head of all our quire,

62,Banjo Paterson,"This is the story of G.R.D., 
Who went on a mission across the sea 
To borrow some money for you and me. 

This G. R. Dibbs was a stalwart man 
Who was built on a most extensive plan, 
And a regular staunch Republican. 

But he fell in the hands of the Tory crew 
Who said, ""It's a shame that a man like you 
Should teach Australia this nasty view. 

""From her mother's side she should ne'er be gone, 
And she ought to be glad to be smiled upon, 
And proud to be known as our hanger-on."" 

And G. R. Dibbs, he went off his peg 
At the swells who came for his smiles to beg 
And the Prince of Wales -- who was pulling his leg 

And he told them all when the wine had flown, 
""The Australian has got no land of his own, 
His home is England, and there alone."" 

So he strutted along with the titled band 
And he sold the pride of his native land 
For a bow and a smile and a shake of the hand. 

And the Tory drummers they sit and call: 
""Send over your leaders great and small; 
For the price is low, and we'll buy them all 

""With a tinsel title, a tawdry star 
Of a lower grade than our titles are, 
And a puff at a prince's big cigar.""

When through the house a shadow passed,

A voice fell like half a brick -- 
""Did ye, or did ye not, pay Crick

But found his foe where'er he fled, 
The sailors swore -- with whitened lip -- 
That Neptune swam behind the ship:

Behold, 'twas no one else but Dan, 
And through the roaring of the gale 
That clarion voice took up the tale, 
""Ahot there! Answer, straight and slick! 
Did not the Ministry pay Crick 
Did they?"" 

In railway trains he sought retreat, 
But soon, from underneath the seat, 
With blazing eye and bristling beard,

There was no dockyard, old or new,

Of all the ministerial clan 
There was no nicer, worthier man

Controlled the dock at Cockatoo. 

To workmen he explained his views --

69,Banjo Paterson,"By the far Samoan shore, 
Where the league-long rollers pour 
All the wash of the Pacific on the coral-guarded bay, 
Riding lightly at their ease, 
In the calm of tropic seas, 
The three great nations' warships at their anchors proudly lay. 
Riding lightly, head to wind, 
With the coral reefs behind, 
Three German and three Yankee ships were mirrored in the blue; 
And on one ship unfurled 
Was the flag that rules the world -- 
For on the old Calliope the flag of England flew. 

When the gentle off-shore breeze, 
That had scarcely stirred the trees, 
Dropped down to utter stillness, and the glass began to fall, 
Away across the main 
Lowered the coming hurricane, 
And far away to seaward hung the cloud-wrack like a pall. 

If the word had passed around, 
""Let us move to safer ground; 
Let us steam away to seaward"" -- then his tale were not to tell! 
But each Captain seemed to say 
""If the others stay, I stay!"" 
And they lingered at their moorings till the shades of evening fell. 

Then the cloud-wrack neared them fast, 
And there came a sudden blast, 
And the hurricane came leaping down a thousand miles of main! 
Like a lion on its prey, 
Leapt the storm fiend on the bay, 
And the vessels shook and shivered as their cables felt the strain. 

As the surging seas came by, 
That were running mountains high, 
The vessels started dragging, drifting slowly to the lee; 
And the darkness of the night 
Hid the coral reefs from sight, 
And the Captains dared not risk the chance to grope their way to sea. 

In the dark they dared not shift! 
They were forced to wait and drift; 
All hands stood by uncertain would the anchors hold or no. 
But the men on deck could see, 
If a chance for them might be, 
There was little chance of safety for the men who were below. 

Through that long, long night of dread, 
While the storm raged overhead, 
They were waiting by their engines, with the furnace fires aroar; 
So they waited, staunch and true, 
Though they knew, and well they knew, 
They must drown like rats imprisoned if the vessel touched the shore. 

When the grey dawn broke at last, 
And the long, long night was past, 
While the hurricane redoubled, lest its prey should steal away, 
On the rocks, all smashed and strown, 
Were the German vessels thrown, 
While the Yankees, swamped and helpless, drifted shorewards down the bay. 

Then at last spoke Captain Kane, 
""All our anchors are in vain, 
And the Germans and the Yankees they have drifted to the lee! 
Cut the cables at the bow! 
We must trust the engines now! 
Give her steam, and let her have it, lads! we'll fight her out to sea!"" 

And the answer came with cheers 
From the stalwart engineers, 
From the grim and grimy firemen at the furnaces below; 
And above the sullen roar 
Of the breakers on the shore 
Came the throbbing of the engines as they laboured to and fro. 

If the strain should find a flaw, 
Should a bolt or rivet draw, 
Then -- God help them! for the vessel were a plaything in the tide! 
With a face of honest cheer 
Quoth an English engineer, 
""I will answer for the engiines that were built on old Thames-side! 

""For the stays and stanchions taut, 
For the rivets truly wrought, 
For the valves that fit their faces as a glove should fit the hand. 
Give her every ounce of power; 
If we make a knot an hour 
Then it's way enough to steer her, and we'll drive her from the land."" 

Life a foam-flake tossed and thrown, 
She could barely hold her own, 
While the other ships all helplessly were drifting to the lee. 
Through the smother and the rout 
The Calliope steamed out -- 
And they cheered her from the Trenton that was foundering in the sea. 

Ay! drifting shoreward there, 
All helpless as they were, 
Their vessel hurled upon the reefs as weed ashore is hurled, 
Without a thought of fear 
The Yankees raised a cheer -- 
A cheer that English-speaking folk should echo round the world.",Ballad
70,Rudyard Kipling,"Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,
     Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God's great Judgment Seat;

     When two strong men stand face to face,
       tho' they come from the ends of the earth!
 
Kamal is out with twenty men to raise the Border-side,
And he has lifted the Colonel's mare that is the Colonel's pride:
He has lifted her out of the stable-door between the dawn and the day,
And turned the calkins upon her feet, and ridden her far away.
Then up and spoke the Colonel's son that led a troop of the Guides:
""Is there never a man of all my men can say where Kamal hides?""
Then up and spoke Mahommed Khan, the son of the Ressaldar:
""If ye know the track of the morning-mist, ye know where his pickets are.
At dusk he harries the Abazai -- at dawn he is into Bonair,
But he must go by Fort Bukloh to his own place to fare,
So if ye gallop to Fort Bukloh as fast as a bird can fly,
By the favour of God ye may cut him off ere he win to the Tongue of Jagai.
But if he be past the Tongue of Jagai, right swiftly turn ye then,
For the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with Kamal's men.
There is rock to the left, and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between,
And ye may hear a breech-bolt snick where never a man is seen.""
The Colonel's son has taken a horse, and a raw rough dun was he,
With the mouth of a bell and the heart of Hell
  and the head of the gallows-tree.
The Colonel's son to the Fort has won, they bid him stay to eat --
Who rides at the tail of a Border thief, he sits not long at his meat.
He's up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can fly,
Till he was aware of his father's mare in the gut of the Tongue of Jagai,
Till he was aware of his father's mare with Kamal upon her back,
And when he could spy the white of her eye, he made the pistol crack.
He has fired once, he has fired twice, but the whistling ball went wide.
""Ye shoot like a soldier,"" Kamal said.  ""Show now if ye can ride.""
It's up and over the Tongue of Jagai, as blown dustdevils go,
The dun he fled like a stag of ten, but the mare like a barren doe.
The dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above,
But the red mare played with the snaffle-bars, as a maiden plays with a glove.
There was rock to the left and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between,
And thrice he heard a breech-bolt snick tho' never a man was seen.
They have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their hoofs drum up the dawn,
The dun he went like a wounded bull, but the mare like a new-roused fawn.
The dun he fell at a water-course -- in a woful heap fell he,
And Kamal has turned the red mare back, and pulled the rider free.
He has knocked the pistol out of his hand -- small room was there to strive,
""'Twas only by favour of mine,"" quoth he, ""ye rode so long alive:
There was not a rock for twenty mile, there was not a clump of tree,
But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee.
If I had raised my bridle-hand, as I have held it low,
The little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row:
If I had bowed my head on my breast, as I have held it high,
The kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly.""
Lightly answered the Colonel's son:  ""Do good to bird and beast,
But count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast.
If there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away,
Belike the price of a jackal's meal were more than a thief could pay.
They will feed their horse on the standing crop,
  their men on the garnered grain,
The thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slain.
But if thou thinkest the price be fair, -- thy brethren wait to sup,
The hound is kin to the jackal-spawn, -- howl, dog, and call them up!
And if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and stack,
Give me my father's mare again, and I'll fight my own way back!""
Kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet.
""No talk shall be of dogs,"" said he, ""when wolf and gray wolf meet.
May I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath;
What dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death?""
Lightly answered the Colonel's son:  ""I hold by the blood of my clan:
Take up the mare for my father's gift -- by God, she has carried a man!""
The red mare ran to the Colonel's son, and nuzzled against his breast;
""We be two strong men,"" said Kamal then, ""but she loveth the younger best.
So she shall go with a lifter's dower, my turquoise-studded rein,
My broidered saddle and saddle-cloth, and silver stirrups twain.""
The Colonel's son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end,
""Ye have taken the one from a foe,"" said he;
  ""will ye take the mate from a friend?""
""A gift for a gift,"" said Kamal straight; ""a limb for the risk of a limb.
Thy father has sent his son to me, I'll send my son to him!""
With that he whistled his only son, that dropped from a mountain-crest --
He trod the ling like a buck in spring, and he looked like a lance in rest.
""Now here is thy master,"" Kamal said, ""who leads a troop of the Guides,
And thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides.
Till Death or I cut loose the tie, at camp and board and bed,
Thy life is his -- thy fate it is to guard him with thy head.
So, thou must eat the White Queen's meat, and all her foes are thine,
And thou must harry thy father's hold for the peace of the Border-line,
And thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power --
Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur.""
 
They have looked each other between the eyes, and there they found no fault,
They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on leavened bread and salt:
They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on fire and fresh-cut sod,
On the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife, and the Wondrous Names of God.
The Colonel's son he rides the mare and Kamal's boy the dun,
And two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one.
And when they drew to the Quarter-Guard, full twenty swords flew clear --
There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer.
""Ha' done! ha' done!"" said the Colonel's son.
  ""Put up the steel at your sides!
Last night ye had struck at a Border thief --
  to-night 'tis a man of the Guides!""
 
     Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,
     Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God's great Judgment Seat;
     But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,
     When two strong men stand face to face,
       tho' they come from the ends of the earth!",Ballad
71,Emily Pauline Johnson,"There are fires on Lulu Island, and the sky is opalescent 
 With the pearl and purple tinting from the smouldering of peat. 
And the Dream Hills lift their summits in a sweeping, hazy crescent, 
 With the Capilano canyon at their feet. 

There are fires on Lulu Island, and the smoke, uplifting, lingers 
 In a faded scarf of fragrance as it creeps across the day, 
And the Inlet and the Narrows blur beneath its silent fingers, 
 And the canyon is enfolded in its grey. 

But the sun its face is veiling like a cloistered nun at vespers; 
 As towards the alter candles of the night a censer swings, 
And the echo of tradition wakes from slumbering and whispers, 
 Where the Capilano river sobs and sings. 

It was Yaada, lovely Yaada, who first taught the stream its sighing, 
 For 'twas silent till her coming, and 'twas voiceless as the shore; 
But throughout the great forever it will sing the song undying 
 That the lips of lovers sing for evermore. 

He was chief of all the Squamish, and he ruled the coastal waters-- 
 And he warred upon her people in the distant Charlotte Isles; 
She, a winsome basket weaver, daintiest of Haida daughters, 
 Made him captive to her singing and her smiles. 

Till his hands forgot to havoc and his weapons lost their lusting, 
 Till his stormy eyes allured her from the land of Totem Poles, 
Till she followed where he called her, followed with a woman's trusting, 
 To the canyon where the Capilano rolls. 

And the women of the Haidas plied in vain their magic power, 
 Wailed for many moons her absence, wailed for many moons their prayer,",Ballad
72,Padraic Colum,"A gaunt built woman and her son-in-law— 
A broad-faced fellow, with such flesh as shows 
Nothing but easy nature—and his wife, 
The woman’s daughter, who spills all her talk 
Out of a wide mouth, but who has eyes as gray 
As Connemara, where the mountain-ash 
Shows berries red indeed: they enter now— 
Our country singers! 
“Sing, my good woman, sing us some romance 
That has been round your chimney-nooks so long 
’Tis nearly native; something blown here 
And since made racy—like yon tree, I might say, 
Native by influence if not by species, 
Shaped by our winds. You understand, I think?” 
“I’ll sing the song, sir.” 
To-night you see my face— 
Maybe nevermore you’ll gaze 
On the one that for you left his friends and kin; 
For by the hard commands 
Of the lord that rules these lands 
On a ship I’ll be borne from Cruckaunfinn! 
Oh, you know your beauty bright 
Has made him think delight 
More than from any fair one he will gain; 
Oh, you know that all his will 
Strains and strives around you till 
As the hawk upon his hand you are as tame! 
Then she to him replied: 
I’ll no longer you deny, 
And I’ll let you have the pleasure of my charms; 
For to-night I’ll be your bride, 
And whatever may betide 
It’s we will lie in one another’s arms! 
“You should not sing 
With body doubled up and face aside— 
There is a climax here—‘It’s we will lie’— 
Hem—passionate! And what does your daughter sing?” 
“A song I like when I do climb bare hills— 
’Tis all about a hawk.” 
No bird that sits on rock or bough 
Has such a front as thine; 
No king that has made war his trade 
Such conquest in his eyne! 
I mark thee rock-like on the rock 
Where none can see a shape. 
I climb, but thou dost climb with wings, 
And like a wish escape, 
She said— 
And like a wish escape! 
No maid that kissed his bonny mouth 
Of another mouth was glad; 
Such pride was in our chieftain’s eyes, 
Such countenance he had! 
But since they made him fly the rocks, 
Thou, creature, art my quest. 
Then lift me with thy steady eyes. 
If then to tear my breast, 
She said— 
If then to tear my breast! 
“The songs they have 
Are the last relics of the feudal world: 
Women will keep them—byzants, doubloons, 
When men will take up songs that are as new 
As dollar bills. What song have you, young man? 
“A song my father had, sir. It was sent him 
From across the sea, and there was a letter with it, 
Asking my father to put it to a tune 
And sing it all roads. He did that, in troth, 
And five pounds of tobacco were sent with the song 
To fore-reward him. I’ll sing it for you now— 
The Baltimore Exile. 
” The house I was bred in—ah, does it remain? 
Low walls and loose thatch standing lone in the rain, 
With the clay of the walls coming through with its stain, 
Like the blackbird’s left nest in the briar! 
Does a child there give heed to the song of the lark, 
As it lifts and it drops till the fall of the dark, 
When the heavy-foot kine trudge home from the paurk, 
Or do none but the red-shank now listen? 
The sloe-bush, I know, grows close to the well, 
And its long-lasting blossoms are there, I can tell, 
When the kid that was yeaned when the first ones befell 
Can jump to the ditch that they grow on! 
But there’s silence on all. Then do none ever pass 
On the way to the fair or the pattern or mass? 
Do the gray-coated lads drive the ball through the grass 
And speed to the sweep of the hurl? 
O youths of my land! Then will no Bolivar 
Ever muster your ranks for delivering war? 
Will your hopes become fixed and beam like a star? 
Will they pass like the mists from your fields? 
The swan and the swallows, the cuckoo and crake, 
May visit my land and find hillside and lake. 
And I send my song. I’ll not see her awake— 
I’m too old a bird to uncage now! 
“Silver’s but lead in exchange for songs, 
But take it and spend it.” 
“We will. And may we meet your honor’s like 
Every day’s end.” 
“A tune is more lasting than the voice of the birds.” 
“A song is more lasting than the riches of the world.”",Ballad
73,Henry Lawson,"Across the stony ridges, 
Across the rolling plain, 
Young Harry Dale, the drover, 
Comes riding home again. 
And well his stock-horse bears him, 
And light of heart is he, 
And stoutly his old pack-horse 
Is trotting by his knee. 

Up Queensland way with cattle 
He travelled regions vast; 
And many months have vanished 
Since home-folk saw him last. 
He hums a song of someone 
He hopes to marry soon; 
And hobble-chains and camp-ware 
Keep jingling to the tune. 

Beyond the hazy dado 
Against the lower skies 
And yon blue line of ranges 
The homestead station lies. 
And thitherward the drover 
Jogs through the lazy noon, 
While hobble-chains and camp-ware 
Are jingling to a tune. 

An hour has filled the heavens 
With storm-clouds inky black; 
At times the lightning trickles 
Around the drover's track; 
But Harry pushes onward, 
His horses' strength he tries, 
In hope to reach the river 
Before the flood shall rise. 

The thunder from above him 
Goes rolling o'er the plain; 
And down on thirsty pastures 
In torrents falls the rain. 
And every creek and gully 
Sends forth its little flood, 
Till the river runs a banker, 
All stained with yellow mud. 

Now Harry speaks to Rover, 
The best dog on the plains, 
And to his hardy horses, 
And strokes their shaggy manes; 
`We've breasted bigger rivers 
When floods were at their height 
Nor shall this gutter stop us 
From getting home to-night!' 

The thunder growls a warning, 
The ghastly lightnings gleam, 
As the drover turns his horses 
To swim the fatal stream. 
But, oh! the flood runs stronger 
Than e'er it ran before; 
The saddle-horse is failing, 
And only half-way o'er! 

When flashes next the lightning, 
The flood's grey breast is blank, 
And a cattle dog and pack-horse 
Are struggling up the bank. 
But in the lonely homestead 
The girl will wait in vain - 
He'll never pass the stations 
In charge of stock again. 

The faithful dog a moment 
Sits panting on the bank, 
And then swims through the current 
To where his master sank. 
And round and round in circles 
He fights with failing strength, 
Till, borne down by the waters, 
The old dog sinks at length. 

Across the flooded lowlands 
And slopes of sodden loam 
The pack-horse struggles onward, 
To take dumb tidings home. 
And mud-stained, wet, and weary, 
Through ranges dark goes he; 
While hobble-chains and tinware 
Are sounding eerily. 

The floods are in the ocean, 
The stream is clear again, 
And now a verdant carpet 
Is stretched across the plain. 
But someone's eyes are saddened, 
And someone's heart still bleeds 
In sorrow for the drover 
Who sleeps among the reeds.",Ballad
74,Alexander Pope,"Ye Lords and Commons, Men of Wit, 
And Pleasure about Town; 
Read this ere you translate one Bit
Of Books of high Renown.

Beware of Latin Authors all!
Nor think your Verses Sterling,
Though with a Golden Pen you scrawl,
And scribble in a Berlin:

For not the Desk with silver Nails,
Nor Bureau of Expense,
Nor standish well japann'd avails,
To writing of good Sense.

Hear how a Ghost in dead of Night,
With saucer Eyes of Fire,
In woeful wise did sore affright
A Wit and courtly 'Squire.

Rare Imp and Phoebus, hopeful Youth
Like Puppy tame that uses
To fetch and carry, in his Mouth,
The Works of all the Muses.

Ah! why did he write Poetry,
That hereto was so civil;
And sell his soul for vanity,
To Rhyming and the Devil?

A Desk he had of curious Work,
With glittering Studs about;
Within the same did Sandys lurk,
Though Ovid lay without.

Now as he scratch'd to fetch up Thought,
Forth popp'd the Sprite so thin;
And from the Key-hole bolted out,
All upright as a Pin.

With Whiskers, Band, and Pantaloon,
And Ruff composed most duly;
This 'Squire he dropp'd his Pen full soon,
While as the Light burnt bluely.

'Ho! Master Sam,' quoth Sandys' sprite,
'Write on, nor let me scare ye;
Forsooth, if Rhymes fall in not right,
To Budgell seek, or Carey.

'I hear the Beat of Jacob's Drums,
Poor Ovid finds no Quarter!
See first the merry Pembroke comes
In Haste, without his Garter.

'Then Lords and Lordlings, 'Squires and Knights,
Wits, Witlings, Prigs and Peers!
Garth at St. James's, and at White's,
Beats up for Volunteers.

'What Fenton will not do, nor Gay,
Nor Congreve, Rowe, nor Stanyan,
Tom Burnet or Tom D'Urfey may,
John Dunton, Steele, or any one.

'If Justice Philips' costive head
Some frigid Rhymes disburses;
They shall like Persian Tales be read,
And glad both Babes and Nurses.

'Let Warwick's Muse with Ashurst join,
And Ozell's with Lord Hervey's:
Tickell and Addison combine,
And P-pe translate with Jervas. 

'Landsdowne himself, that lively Lord,
Who bows to every Lady,
Shall join with Frowde in one Accord,
And be like Tate and Brady.

'Ye Ladies too draw forth your pen,
I pray where can the hurt lie?
Since you have Brains as well as Men,
As witness Lady Wortley.

'Now, Tonson, list thy Forces all,
Review them, and tell Noses;
For to poor Ovid shall befal
A strange Metamorphosis. 

'A Metamorphosis more strange
Than all his Books can vapour;'
'To what' (quoth 'squire) 'shall Ovid change?'
Quoth Sandys: 'To waste paper.'",Ballad
75,Friedrich Schiller,"Upon his battlements he stood,
And downward gazed in joyous mood,
   On Samos' Isle, that owned his sway,
""All this is subject to my yoke;""
To Egypt's monarch thus he spoke,--
   ""That I am truly blest, then, say!""

""The immortals' favor thou hast known!
Thy sceptre's might has overthrown
   All those who once were like to thee.
Yet to avenge them one lives still;
I cannot call thee blest, until
   That dreaded foe has ceased to be.""

While to these words the king gave vent,
A herald from Miletus sent,
   Appeared before the tyrant there:
""Lord, let thy incense rise to-day,
And with the laurel branches gay
   Thou well may'st crown thy festive hair!""

""Thy foe has sunk beneath the spear,--
I'm sent to bear the glad news here,
   By thy true marshal Polydore""--
Then from a basin black he takes--
The fearful sight their terror wakes--
   A well-known head, besmeared with gore.

The king with horror stepped aside,
And then with anxious look replied:
   ""Thy bliss to fortune ne'er commit.
On faithless waves, bethink thee how
Thy fleet with doubtful fate swims now--
   How soon the storm may scatter it!""

But ere he yet had spoke the word,
A shout of jubilee is heard
   Resounding from the distant strand.
With foreign treasures teeming o'er,
The vessels' mast-rich wood once more
   Returns home to its native land.

The guest then speaks with startled mind:
""Fortune to-day, in truth, seems kind;
   But thou her fickleness shouldst fear:
The Cretan hordes, well skilled, in arms,
Now threaten thee with war's alarms;
   E'en now they are approaching here.""

And, ere the word has 'scaped his lips,
A stir is seen amongst the ships,
   And thousand voices ""Victory!"" cry:
""We are delivered from our foe,
The storm has laid the Cretan low,
   The war is ended, is gone by!""

The shout with horror hears the guest:
""In truth, I must esteem thee blest!
   Yet dread I the decrees of heaven.
The envy of the gods I fear;
To taste of unmixed rapture here
   Is never to a mortal given.""

""With me, too, everything succeeds;
In all my sovereign acts and deeds
   The grace of Heaven is ever by;
And yet I had a well-loved heir--
I paid my debt to fortune there--
   God took him hence--I saw him die.""

""Wouldst thou from sorrow, then, be free.
Pray to each unseen Deity,
   For thy well-being, grief to send;
The man on whom the Gods bestow
Their gifts with hands that overflow,
   Comes never to a happy end.""

""And if the Gods thy prayer resist,
Then to a friend's instruction list,--
   Invoke thyself adversity;
And what, of all thy treasures bright,
Gives to thy heart the most delight--
   That take and cast thou in the sea!""

Then speaks the other, moved by fear:
""This ring to me is far most dear
   Of all this isle within it knows--
I to the furies pledge it now,
If they will happiness allow""--
   And in the flood the gem he throws.

And with the morrow's earliest light,
Appeared before the monarch's sight
   A fisherman, all joyously;
""Lord, I this fish just now have caught,
No net before e'er held the sort;
   And as a gift I bring it thee.""

The fish was opened by the cook,
Who suddenly, with wondering look,
   Runs up, and utters these glad sounds:
""Within the fish's maw, behold,
I've found, great lord, thy ring of gold!
   Thy fortune truly knows no bounds!""

The guest with terror turned away:
""I cannot here, then, longer stay,--
   My friend thou canst no longer be!
The gods have willed that thou shouldst die:
Lest I, too, perish, I must fly""--
   He spoke,--and sailed thence hastily.",Ballad
76,Sir Walter Scott,"The herring loves the merry moon-light,
The mackerel loves the wind,
But the oyster loves the dredging sang,
For they come of a gentle kind.

Now haud your tongue, baith wife and carle,
And listen great and sma',

That fought on the red Harlaw.

And doun the Don and a',
And hieland and lawland may mournfu' be

They saddled a hundred milk-white steeds,
They hae bridled a hundred black,
With a chafron of steel on each horse's head,
And a good knight upon his back.

They hadna ridden a mile, a mile,
A mile, but barely ten,
When Donald came branking down the brae
Wi' twenty thousand men.

Their tartans they were waving wide,
Their glaives were glancing clear,

That Highland host to see:
'Now here a knight that's stout and good
May prove a jeopardie:

To fight were wond'rous peril,-
What would ye do now, Roland Cheyne,
Were ye Glenallan's Earl?'-

'Were I Glenallan's Earl this tide,
And ye were Roland Cheyne,
The spear should be in my horse's side,
And the bridle upon his mane.

'If they hae twenty thousand blades,
And we twice ten times ten,
Yet they hae but their tartan plaids,
And we are mail-clad men.

'My horse shall ride through ranks sae rude,
As through the moorland fern,-
Then ne'er let the gentle Norman blude
Grow cauld for Highland kerne.'

The death-bell beats!--
The mountain repeats
The echoing sound of the knell;
And the dark Monk now
Wraps the cowl round his brow,
As he sits in his lonely cell.

II.
And the cold hand of death
Chills his shuddering breath,
As he lists to the fearful lay
Which the ghosts of the sky,
As they sweep wildly by,
Sing to departed day.
And they sing of the hour
When the stern fates had power
To resolve Rosa’s form to its clay.

III.
But that hour is past;
And that hour was the last
Of peace to the dark Monk’s brain.
Bitter tears, from his eyes, gushed silent and fast;
And he strove to suppress them in vain. 

IV.
Then his fair cross of gold he dashed on the floor,
When the death-knell struck on his ear.--
'Delight is in store
For her evermore;
But for me is fate, horror, and fear.'

V.
Then his eyes wildly rolled,
When the death-bell tolled,
And he raged in terrific woe.
And he stamped on the ground,--
But when ceased the sound,
Tears again began to flow.

VI.
And the ice of despair
Chilled the wild throb of care,
And he sate in mute agony still;
Till the night-stars shone through the cloudless air,
And the pale moonbeam slept on the hill.

VII.
Then he knelt in his cell:--
And the horrors of hell
Were delights to his agonized pain,
And he prayed to God to dissolve the spell, 
Which else must for ever remain.

VIII.
And in fervent pray'r he knelt on the ground,
Till the abbey bell struck One:
His feverish blood ran chill at the sound:
A voice hollow and horrible murmured around--
'The term of thy penance is done!'

IX.
Grew dark the night;
The moonbeam bright
Waxed faint on the mountain high;
And, from the black hill, 
Went a voice cold and still,--
'Monk! thou art free to die.'

X.
Then he rose on his feet,
And his heart loud did beat,
And his limbs they were palsied with dread; 
Whilst the grave's clammy dew
O'er his pale forehead grew;
And he shuddered to sleep with the dead.

XI.
And the wild midnight storm
Raved around his tall form, 
As he sought the chapel's gloom:
And the sunk grass did sigh
To the wind, bleak and high,
As he searched for the new-made tomb.

XII.
And forms, dark and high, 
Seemed around him to fly,
And mingle their yells with the blast:
And on the dark wall
Half-seen shadows did fall,
As enhorrored he onward passed.

XIII.
And the storm-fiends wild rave
O’er the new-made grave,
And dread shadows linger around.
The Monk called on God his soul to save,
And, in horror, sank on the ground. 

XIV.
Then despair nerved his arm
To dispel the charm,
And he burst Rosa's coffin asunder.
And the fierce storm did swell
More terrific and fell,
And louder pealed the thunder.

XV.
And laughed, in joy, the fiendish throng,
Mixed with ghosts of the mouldering dead:
And their grisly wings, as they floated along,
Whistled in murmurs dread.

XVI.
And her skeleton form the dead Nun reared
Which dripped with the chill dew of hell.
In her half-eaten eyeballs two pale flames appeared,
And triumphant their gleam on the dark Monk glared,
As he stood within the cell. 

XVII.
And her lank hand lay on his shuddering brain;
But each power was nerved by fear.--
'I never, henceforth, may breathe again;
Death now ends mine anguished pain.--
The grave yawns,--we meet there.'

XVIII.
And her skeleton lungs did utter the sound,
So deadly, so lone, and so fell,
That in long vibrations shuddered the ground;
And as the stern notes floated around,
A deep groan was answered from hell.",Ballad
79,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,"Come hither, gently rowing,
Come, bear me quickly o'er
This stream so brightly flowing
To yonder woodland shore.
But vain were my endeavour
To pay thee, courteous guide;
Row on, row on, for ever
I'd have thee by my side.

Good boatman, prithee haste thee,
I seek my father-land. --
Say, when I there have placed thee,
Dare I demand thy hand?
A maiden's head can never
So hard a point decide;
Row on, row on, for ever
I'd have thee by my side.

The happy bridal over
The wanderer ceased to roam,
For, seated by her lover,
The boat became her home.
And they still sang together
As steering o'er the tide:
Row on through wind and weather
For ever by my side.",Ballad

The children of the Czar
Played with a bouncing ball

In the May morning, in the Czar's garden,
Tossing it back and forth.

It fell among the flowerbeds
Or fled to the north gate.

A daylight moon hung up
In the Western sky, bald white.

Like Papa's face, said Sister,
Hurling the white ball forth.

Hid in a wine-stinking barrel,
For three days in Bucharest

Then left for America
To become a king himself.

        3
 
I am my father's father,
You are your children's guilt.

In history's pity and terror
The child is Aeneas again;

Troy is in the nursery,
The rocking horse is on fire.

Child labor! The child must carry
His fathers on his back.

But seeing that so much is past
And that history has no ruth

For the individual,
Who drinks tea, who catches cold,

Let anger be general:
I hate an abstract thing.

Brother and sister bounced
The bounding, unbroken ball,

The shattering sun fell down
Like swords upon their play,

Moving eastward among the stars
Toward February and October.

But the Maywind brushed their cheeks
Like a mother watching sleep,

And if for a moment they fight
Over the bouncing ball

And sister pinches brother
And brother kicks her shins,

Well! The heart of man in known:
It is a cactus bloom.

        5
 
The ground on which the ball bounces
Is another bouncing ball.

The wheeling, whirling world
Makes no will glad.

Spinning in its spotlight darkness,
It is too big for their hands.

A pitiless, purposeless Thing,
Arbitrary, and unspent,

Made for no play, for no children,
But chasing only itself.

The innocent are overtaken,
They are not innocent.

They are their father's fathers,
The past is inevitable.

        6
 
Now, in another October
Of this tragic star,

I see my second year,
I eat my baked potato.

It is my buttered world,
But, poked by my unlearned hand,

It falls from the highchair down
And I begin to howl

And I see the ball roll under
The iron gate which is locked.

Sister is screaming, brother is howling,
The ball has evaded their will.

Even a bouncing ball
Is uncontrollable,

And is under the garden wall.
I am overtaken by terror

Thinking of my father's fathers,
And of my own will.",Ballad
81,Percy Bysshe Shelley,"I.
Once, early in the morning, Beelzebub arose,
With care his sweet person adorning,
He put on his Sunday clothes.

II.
He drew on a boot to hide his hoof, 
He drew on a glove to hide his claw,
His horns were concealed by a Bras Chapeau,
And the Devil went forth as natty a Beau
As Bond-street ever saw.

III.
He sate him down, in London town, 
Before earth's morning ray;
With a favourite imp he began to chat,
On religion, and scandal, this and that,
Until the dawn of day.

IV.
And then to St. James's Court he went, 
And St. Paul’s Church he took on his way;
He was mighty thick with every Saint,
Though they were formal and he was gay.

V.
The Devil was an agriculturist,
And as bad weeds quickly grow, 
In looking over his farm, I wist,
He wouldn't find cause for woe.

VI.
He peeped in each hole, to each chamber stole,
His promising live-stock to view;
Grinning applause, he just showed them his claws, 
And they shrunk with affright from his ugly sight,
Whose work they delighted to do.

VII.
Satan poked his red nose into crannies so small
One would think that the innocents fair,
Poor lambkins! were just doing nothing at all 
But settling some dress or arranging some ball,
But the Devil saw deeper there.

VIII.
A Priest, at whose elbow the Devil during prayer
Sate familiarly, side by side,
Declared that, if the Tempter were there, 
His presence he would not abide.
Ah! ah! thought Old Nick, that's a very stale trick,
For without the Devil, O favourite of Evil,
In your carriage you would not ride.

IX.
Satan next saw a brainless King,
Whose house was as hot as his own;
Many Imps in attendance were there on the wing,
They flapped the pennon and twisted the sting,
Close by the very Throne.

X.
Ah! ah! thought Satan, the pasture is good,
My Cattle will here thrive better than others;
They dine on news of human blood,
They sup on the groans of the dying and dead,
And supperless never will go to bed;
Which will make them fat as their brothers. 

XI.
Fat as the Fiends that feed on blood,
Fresh and warm from the fields of Spain,
Where Ruin ploughs her gory way,
Where the shoots of earth are nipped in the bud,
Where Hell is the Victor's prey, 
Its glory the meed of the slain.

XII.
Fat--as the Death-birds on Erin's shore,
That glutted themselves in her dearest gore,
And flitted round Castlereagh,
When they snatched the Patriot's heart, that HIS grasp 
Had torn from its widow's maniac clasp,
--And fled at the dawn of day.

XIII.
Fat--as the Reptiles of the tomb,
That riot in corruption's spoil,
That fret their little hour in gloom, 
And creep, and live the while.

XIV.
Fat as that Prince's maudlin brain,
Which, addled by some gilded toy,
Tired, gives his sweetmeat, and again
Cries for it, like a humoured boy. 

XV.
For he is fat,--his waistcoat gay,
When strained upon a levee day,
Scarce meets across his princely paunch;
And pantaloons are like half-moons
Upon each brawny haunch. 

XVI.
How vast his stock of calf! when plenty
Had filled his empty head and heart,
Enough to satiate foplings twenty,
Could make his pantaloon seams start.

XVII.
The Devil (who sometimes is called Nature), 
For men of power provides thus well,
Whilst every change and every feature,
Their great original can tell.

XVIII.
Satan saw a lawyer a viper slay,
That crawled up the leg of his table,
It reminded him most marvellously
Of the story of Cain and Abel.

IXX.
The wealthy yeoman, as he wanders
His fertile fields among,
And on his thriving cattle ponders,
Counts his sure gains, and hums a song;
Thus did the Devil, through earth walking,
Hum low a hellish song.

XX.
For they thrive well whose garb of gore
Is Satan’s choicest livery, 
And they thrive well who from the poor
Have snatched the bread of penury,
And heap the houseless wanderer’s store
On the rank pile of luxury.

XXI.
The Bishops thrive, though they are big; 
The Lawyers thrive, though they are thin;
For every gown, and every wig,
Hides the safe thrift of Hell within.

XXII.
Thus pigs were never counted clean,
Although they dine on finest corn; 
And cormorants are sin-like lean,
Although they eat from night to morn.

XXIII.
Oh! why is the Father of Hell in such glee,
As he grins from ear to ear?
Why does he doff his clothes joyfully,
As he skips, and prances, and flaps his wing,
As he sidles, leers, and twirls his sting,
And dares, as he is, to appear?

XXIV.
A statesman passed--alone to him,
The Devil dare his whole shape uncover, 
To show each feature, every limb,
Secure of an unchanging lover.

XXV.
At this known sign, a welcome sight,
The watchful demons sought their King,
And every Fiend of the Stygian night, 
Was in an instant on the wing.

XXVI.
Pale Loyalty, his guilt-steeled brow,
With wreaths of gory laurel crowned:
The hell-hounds, Murder, Want and Woe,
Forever hungering, flocked around; 
From Spain had Satan sought their food,
'Twas human woe and human blood!

XXVII.
Hark! the earthquake's crash I hear,--
Kings turn pale, and Conquerors start,
Ruffians tremble in their fear,
For their Satan doth depart.

XXVIII.
This day Fiends give to revelry
To celebrate their King's return,
And with delight its Sire to see
Hell's adamantine limits burn. 

XXIX.
But were the Devil's sight as keen
As Reason's penetrating eye,
His sulphurous Majesty I ween,
Would find but little cause for joy.

XXX.
For the sons of Reason see 
That, ere fate consume the Pole,
The false Tyrant's cheek shall be
Bloodless as his coward soul.",Ballad
82,Eugene Field,"Up yonder in Buena Park
There is a famous spot,
In legend and in history
Yclept the Waller Lot.

There children play in daytime
And lovers stroll by dark,
For 't is the goodliest trysting-place
In all Buena Park.

Once on a time that beauteous maid,
Sweet little Sissy Knott,
Took out her pretty doll to walk
Within the Waller Lot.

While thus she fared, from Ravenswood
Came Injuns o'er the plain,
And seized upon that beauteous maid
And rent her doll in twain.

Oh, 't was a piteous thing to hear
Her lamentations wild;
She tore her golden curls and cried:
""My child! My child! My child!""

Alas, what cared those Injun chiefs
How bitterly wailed she?
They never had been mothers,
And they could not hope to be!

""Have done with tears,"" they rudely quoth,
And then they bound her hands;
For they proposed to take her off
To distant border lands.

But, joy! from Mr. Eddy's barn
Doth Willie Clow behold
The sight that makes his hair rise up
And all his blood run cold.

He put his fingers in his mouth
And whistled long and clear,
And presently a goodly horde
Of cow-boys did appear.

Cried Willie Clow: ""My comrades bold,
Haste to the Waller Lot,
And rescue from that Injun band
Our charming Sissy Knott!""

""Spare neither Injun buck nor squaw,
But smite them hide and hair!
Spare neither sex nor age nor size,
And no condition spare!""

Then sped that cow-boy band away,
Full of revengeful wrath,
And Kendall Evans rode ahead
Upon a hickory lath.

And next came gallant Dady Field
And Willie's brother Kent,
The Eddy boys and Robbie James,
On murderous purpose bent.

For they were much beholden to
That maid - in sooth, the lot
Were very, very much in love
With charming Sissy Knott.

What wonder? She was beauty's queen,
And good beyond compare;
Moreover, it was known she was
Her wealthy father's heir!

Now when the Injuns saw that band
They trembled with affright,
And yet they thought the cheapest thing
To do was stay and fight.

So sturdily they stood their ground,
Nor would their prisoner yield,
Despite the wrath of Willie Clow
And gallant Dady Field.

Oh, never fiercer battle raged
Upon the Waller Lot,
And never blood more freely flowed
Than flowed for Sissy Knott!

An Injun chief of monstrous size
Got Kendall Evans down,
And Robbie James was soon o'erthrown
By one of great renown.

And Dady Field was sorely done,
And Willie Clow was hurt,
And all that gallant cow-boy band
Lay wallowing in the dirt.

But still they strove with might and main
Till all the Waller Lot
Was strewn with hair and gouts of gore -
All, all for Sissy Knott!

Then cried the maiden in despair:
""Alas, I sadly fear
The battle and my hopes are lost,
Unless some help appear!""

Lo, as she spoke, she saw afar
The rescuer looming up -
The pride of all Buena Park,
Clow's famous yellow pup!

""Now, sick'em, Don,"" the maiden cried,
""Now, sick'em, Don!"" cried she;
Obedient Don at once complied -
As ordered, so did he.

He sicked'em all so passing well
That, overcome by fright,
The Indian horde gave up the fray
And safety sought in flight.

They ran and ran and ran and ran
O'er valley, plain, and hill;
And if they are not walking now,
Why, then, they're running still.

The cow-boys rose up from the dust
With faces black and blue;
""Remember, beauteous maid,"" said they,
""We've bled and died for you!""

""And though we suffer grievously,
We gladly hail the lot
That brings us toils and pains and wounds
For charming Sissy Knott!""

But Sissy Knott still wailed and wept,
And still her fate reviled;
For who could patch her dolly up -
Who, who could mend her child?

Then out her doting mother came,
And soothed her daughter then;
""Grieve not, my darling, I will sew
Your dolly up again!""

Joy soon succeeded unto grief,
And tears were soon dried up,
And dignities were heaped upon
Clow's noble yellow pup.

Him all that goodly company
Did as deliverer hail -
They tied a ribbon round his neck,
Another round his tail.

And every anniversary day
Upon the Waller Lot
They celebrate the victory won
For charming Sissy Knott.

And I, the poet of these folk,
Am ordered to compile
This truly famous history
In good old ballad style.

Which having done as to have earned
The sweet rewards of fame,
In what same style I did begin
I now shall end the same.

So let us sing: Long live the King,
Long live the Queen and Jack,
Long live the ten-spot and the ace,
And also all the pack.",Ballad
83,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,"Beneath yon birch with silver bark,
And boughs so pendulous and fair,
The brook falls scatter'd down the rock:
And all is mossy there!

And there upon the moss she sits,
The Dark Ladie in silent pain;
The heavy tear is in her eye,
And drops and swells again.

Three times she sends her little page
Up the castled mountain's breast,
If he might find the Knight that wears
The Griffin for his crest.

The sun was sloping down the sky,
And she had linger'd there all day,
Counting moments, dreaming fears--
Oh wherefore can he stay?

She hears a rustling o'er the brook,
She sees far off a swinging bough!
''Tis He! 'Tis my betrothed Knight!
Lord Falkland, it is Thou!'

She springs, she clasps him round the neck,
She sobs a thousand hopes and fears,
Her kisses glowing on his cheeks
She quenches with her tears.

* * * * *

'My friends with rude ungentle words
They scoff and bid me fly to thee!
O give me shelter in thy breast!
O shield and shelter me!

'My Henry, I have given thee much,
I gave what I can ne'er recall,
I gave my heart, I gave my peace,
O Heaven! I gave thee all.'

The Knight made answer to the Maid,
While to his heart he held her hand,
'Nine castles hath my noble sire,
None statelier in the land.

'The fairest one shall be my love's,
The fairest castle of the nine!
Wait only till the stars peep out,
The fairest shall be thine:

'Wait only till the hand of eve
Hath wholly closed yon western bars,
And through the dark we two will steal
Beneath the twinkling stars!'--

'The dark? the dark? No! not the dark?
The twinkling stars? How, Henry? How?
O God! 'twas in the eye of noon
He pledged his sacred vow!

'And in the eye of noon my love
Shall lead me from my mother's door,
Sweet boys and girls all clothed in white
Strewing flowers before:

'But first the nodding minstrels go
With music meet for lordly bowers,
The children next in snow-white vests,
Strewing buds and flowers!

'And then my love and I shall pace,
My jet black hair in pearly braids,
Between our comely bachelors
And blushing bridal maids.'

* * * * *",Ballad
84,Thomas Babbington Macaulay,"As I sate down to breakfast in state, 
At my living of Tithing-cum-Boring, 
With Betty beside me to wait, 
Came a rap that almost beat the door in. 
I laid down my basin of tea, 
And Betty ceased spreading the toast, 
""As sure as a gun, sir,"" said she, 
""That must be the knock of the post."" 

A letter--and free--bring it here-- 
I have no correspondent who franks. 
No! Yes! Can it be? Why, my dear, 
'Tis our glorious, our Protestant Bankes. 
""Dear sir, as I know you desire 
That the Church should receive due protection, 
I humbly presume to require 
Your aid at the Cambridge election. 

""It has lately been brought to my knowledge, 
That the Ministers fully design 
To suppress each cathedral and college, 
And eject every learned divine. 
To assist this detestable scheme 
Three nuncios from Rome are come over; 
They left Calais on Monday by steam, 
And landed to dinner at Dover. 

""An army of grim Cordeliers, 
Well furnished with relics and vermin, 
Will follow, Lord Westmoreland fears, 
To effect what their chiefs may determine. 
Lollard's bower, good authorities say, 
Is again fitting up for a prison; 
And a wood-merchant told me to-day 
'Tis a wonder how faggots have risen. 

""The finance scheme of Canning contains 
A new Easter-offering tax; 
And he means to devote all the gains 
To a bounty on thumb-screws and racks. 
Your living, so neat and compact-- 
Pray, don't let the news give you pain!-- 
Is promised, I know for a fact, 
To an olive-faced Padre from Spain."" 

I read, and I felt my heart bleed, 
Sore wounded with horror and pity; 
So I flew, with all possible speed, 
To our Protestant champion's committee. 
True gentlemen, kind and well-bred! 
No fleering! no distance! no scorn! 
They asked after my wife who is dead, 
And my children who never were born. 

They then, like high-principled Tories, 
Called our Sovereign unjust and unsteady, 
And assailed him with scandalous stories, 
Till the coach for the voters was ready. 
That coach might be well called a casket 
Of learning and brotherly love: 
There were parsons in boot and in basket; 
There were parsons below and above. 

There were Sneaker and Griper, a pair 
Who stick to Lord Mulesby like leeches; 
A smug chaplain of plausible air, 
Who writes my Lord Goslingham's speeches. 
Dr Buzz, who alone is a host, 
Who, with arguments weighty as lead, 
Proves six times a week in the Post 
That flesh somehow differs from bread. 

Dr Nimrod, whose orthodox toes 
Are seldom withdrawn from the stirrup; 
Dr Humdrum, whose eloquence flows, 
Like droppings of sweet poppy syrup; 
Dr Rosygill puffing and fanning, 
And wiping away perspiration; 
Dr Humbug who proved Mr Canning 
The beast in St John's Revelation. 

A layman can scarce form a notion 
Of our wonderful talk on the road; 
Of the learning, the wit, and devotion, 
Which almost each syllable showed: 
Why divided allegiance agrees 
So ill with our free constitution; 
How Catholics swear as they please, 
In hope of the priest's absolution; 

How the Bishop of Norwich had bartered 
His faith for a legate's commission; 
How Lyndhurst, afraid to be martyr'd, 
Had stooped to a base coalition; 
How Papists are cased from compassion 
By bigotry, stronger than steel; 
How burning would soon come in fashion, 
And how very bad it must feel. 

We were all so much touched and excited 
By a subject so direly sublime, 
That the rules of politeness were slighted, 
And we all of us talked at a time; 
And in tones, which each moment grew louder, 
Told how we should dress for the show, 
And where we should fasten the powder, 
And if we should bellow or no. 

Thus from subject to subject we ran, 
And the journey passed pleasantly o'er, 
Till at last Dr Humdrum began; 
From that time I remember no more. 
At Ware he commenced his prelection, 
In the dullest of clerical drones; 
And when next I regained recollection 
We were rambling o'er Trumpington stones.",Ballad
85,Yevgeny Yevtushenko,"We’ve been bewitched by countless lies, 
by azure images of ice, 
by false promises of open sky and sea, 
and rescued by a God we don’t believe.
Like coppers rattling from a beggar’s plate
guiding lights have fallen on our days
and burned and died.
We’ve pressed our ship
a pilgrimage of nights toward such lights
as, always elusive, lured and tricked
the keel upon the rocks and ripped
the helmhold from the hand and lashed
the beggared palm to scraps.
Ice tightens at the bow and breath.
To dock, to dropp the anchor to its rest, 
to drift (a dream!)  on waters quieted
and calmed. We can’t. We’re after a mirage.
(The whiskered walrus brays; the sea salt thaws.
Again, we’re off!) 
Raised on powdered milk, we’ll have no faith
in beacons any longer, nor mistake
real for fake, or waking for a dream.
Beacons can’t be trusted. Trust instead
the will of your own hand and head.
Again the captain waves his glass, 
sights a beacon, turns and cries
'Helmsman! There’s a beacon. Are you blind? '
But Helmsman, with the truer eye
thinks mutiny and grumbles, 
 'A mirage.'",Ballad
86,George Gordon Byron,"Which, in the Arabic language, is to the following purport:

I
THE Moorish King rides up and down,
Through Granada's royal town;
From Elvira's gate to those
Of Bivarambla on he goes.
Woe is me, Alhama!

II
Letters to the monarch tell 
How Alhama's city fell: 
In the fire the scroll he threw, 
And the messenger he slew.
Woe is me, Albamal

III
He quits his mule, and mounts his horse, 
And through the street directs his course; 
Through the street of Zacatin 
To the Alhambra spurring in.
Woe is me, Alhama!

IV
When the Alhambra walls he gain'd, 
On the moment he ordain'd
That the trumpet straight should sound 
With the silver clarion round.
Woe is me, Alhamal

V
And when the hollow drums of war 
Beat the loud alarm afar, 
That the Moors of town and plain 
Might answer to the martial strain.
Woe is me, Alhama!

VI
Then the Moors, by this aware, 
That bloody Mars recall'd them there, 
One by one, and two by two, 
To a mighty squadron grew.
Woe is me, Alhama!

VII
Out then spake an aged Moor 
In these words the king before, 
'Wherefore call on us, oh King? 
What may mean this gathering?'
Woe is me, Alhama!

VIII
'Friends! ye have, alas! to know 
Of a most disastrous blow; 
That the Christians, stern and bold, 
Have obtain'd Albania's hold.'
Woe is me, Alhama!

IX
Out then spake old Alfaqui, 
With his beard so white to see, 
'Good King! thou art justly served, 
Good King! this thou hast deserved.
Woe is me, Alhama!

X
'By thee were slain, in evil hour, 
The Abencerrage, Granada's flower; 
And strangers were received by thee 
Of Cordova the Chivalry.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XI
'And for this, oh King! is sent 
On thee a double chastisement: 
Thee and thine, thy crown and realm, 
One last wreck shall overwhelm.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XII
'He who holds no laws in awe, 
He must perish by the law; 
And Granada must be won, 
And thyself with her undone.'
Woe is me, Alhama!

XIII
Fire Crashed from out the old Moor's eyes, 
The Monarch's wrath began to rise, 
Because he answer'd, and because 
He spake exceeding well of laws.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XIV
'There is no law to say such things 
As may disgust the ear of kings:
'Thus, snorting with his choler, said 
The Moorish King, and doom'd him dead.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XV
Moor Alfaqui! Moor Alfaqui! 
Though thy beard so hoary be, 
The King hath sent to have thee seized, 
For Alhama's loss displeased.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XVI
And to fix thy head upon 
High Alhambra's loftiest stone; 
That thus for thee should be the law, 
And others tremble when they saw.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XVII
'Cavalier, and man of worth! 
Let these words of mine go forth! 
Let the Moorish Monarch know,
That to him I nothing owe.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XVIII
'But on my soul Alhama weighs, 
And on my inmost spirit preys;
And if the King his land hath lost, 
Yet others may have lost the most.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XIX
'Sires have lost their children, wives 
Their lords, and valiant men their lives! 
One what best his love might claim 
Hath lost, another wealth, or fame.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XX
'I lost a damsel in that hour, 
Of all the land the loveliest flower; 
Doubloons a hundred I would pay, 
And think her ransom cheap that day.'
Woe is me, Alhama!

XXI
And as these things the old Moor said, 
They sever'd from the trunk his head; 
And to the Alhambra's wall with speed 
'Twas carried, as the King decreed.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XXII
And men and infants therein weep 
Their loss, so heavy and so deep; 
Granada's ladies, all she rears 
Within her walls, burst into tears.
Woe is me, Alhama!

XXIII
And from the windows o'er the walls 
The sable web of mourning falls; 
The King weeps as a woman o'er 
His loss, for it is much and sore.
Woe is me, Alhama!",Ballad
87,Marie E J Pitt,"DOWN harvest headlands the fairy host   
 Of the poppy banners have flashed and fled,   
The lilies have faded like ghost and ghost,   
 The ripe rose rots in the garden bed.   
The grain is garnered, the blooms are shed,           
 Convolvulus springs on the snowdrop’s bier,   
In her stranded gold is the silver thread

Wistful the welkin with wordless dread,   
 Mournful the uplands, all ashen sere—   
Sad for the snow on a beauteous head—           
 For the first grey hair i’ the head o’ the year.   
 
Time trysts with Death at the finger-post,   
 Where the broken issues of life are wed—   
Intone no dirges, fill up the toast

A truce to trouble!—we’ll drink instead   
 To the first grey hair i’ the head o’ the year.   
 
South Esk sings on where the furze-fires spread,

The hooker of that hammerfast viking
And Gall's curse on the day when Eblana bay
Saw his black and tan man-o'-war.

It was during some fresh water garden pumping
Or, according to the Nursing Mirror, while admiring the monkeys
That our heavyweight heathen Humpharey
Made bold a maid to woo
  (Chorus) Woohoo, what'll she doo!
           The general lost her maidenloo!

He ought to blush for himself, the old hayheaded philosopher,
For to go and shove himself that way on top of her.
Begob, he's the crux of the catalogue
Of our antediluvial zoo,

And he caught his death of fusiliers,

'Tis sore pity for his innocent poor children
But look out for his missus legitimate!

Then we'll have a free trade Gael's band and mass meeting
For to sod him the brave son of Scandiknavery.
And we'll bury him down in Oxmanstown
Along with the devil and the Danes,
  (Chorus) With the deaf and dumb Danes,
           And all their remains.

And not all the king's men nor his horses
Will resurrect his corpus
For there's no true spell in Connacht or hell

89,Paul Laurence Dunbar,"I KNOW my love is true,
And oh the day is fair.
The sky is dear and blue,
The flowers are rich of hue,
The air I breathe is rare,
I have no grief or care;
For my own love is true,
And oh the day is fair.
My love is false I find,
And oh the day is dark.
Blows sadly down the wind,
While sorrow holds my mind;
I do not hear the lark,
For quenched is life's dear spark,—
My love is false I find,
And oh the day is dark!
For love doth make the day
Or dark or doubly bright;
Her beams along the way
Dispel the gloom and gray. 
She lives and all is bright,
She dies and life is night.
For love doth make the day,
Or dark or doubly bright.",Ballad
90,Robert Southey,"I.

Who is she, the poor Maniac, whose wildly-fix'd eyes
 Seem a heart overcharged to express?
She weeps not, yet often and deeply she sighs,
She never complains, but her silence implies
 The composure of settled distress.


II.

No aid, no compassion the Maniac will seek,
 Cold and hunger awake not her care:
Thro' her rags do the winds of the winter blow bleak
On her poor withered bosom half bare, and her cheek
 Has the deathy pale hue of despair.


III.

Yet chearful and happy, nor distant the day,
 Poor Mary the Maniac has been;
The Traveller remembers who journeyed this way
No damsel so lovely, no damsel so gay
 As Mary the Maid of the Inn.


IV.

Her chearful address fill'd the guests with delight
 As she welcomed them in with a smile:
Her heart was a stranger to childish affright,
And Mary would walk by the Abbey at night
 When the wind whistled down the dark aisle.


V.

She loved, and young Richard had settled the day,
 And she hoped to be happy for life;
But Richard was idle and worthless, and they
Who knew him would pity poor Mary and say
 That she was too good for his wife.


VI.

'Twas in autumn, and stormy and dark was the night,
 And fast were the windows and door;
Two guests sat enjoying the fire that burnt bright,
And smoking in silence with tranquil delight
 They listen'd to hear the wind roar.


VII.

""Tis pleasant,"" cried one, ""seated by the fire side
 ""To hear the wind whistle without.""
""A fine night for the Abbey!"" his comrade replied,
""Methinks a man's courage would now be well tried
 ""Who should wander the ruins about.


VIII.

""I myself, like a school-boy, should tremble to hear
 ""The hoarse ivy shake over my head;
""And could fancy I saw, half persuaded by fear,
""Some ugly old Abbot's white spirit appear,
 ""For this wind might awaken the dead!""


IX.

""I'll wager a dinner,"" the other one cried,
 ""That Mary would venture there now.""
""Then wager and lose!"" with a sneer he replied,
""I'll warrant she'd fancy a ghost by her side,
 ""And faint if she saw a white cow.""


X.

""Will Mary this charge on her courage allow?""
 His companion exclaim'd with a smile;
""I shall win, for I know she will venture there now,
""And earn a new bonnet by bringing a bough
 ""From the elder that grows in the aisle.""


XI.

With fearless good humour did Mary comply,
 And her way to the Abbey she bent;
The night it was dark, and the wind it was high
And as hollowly howling it swept thro' the sky
 She shiver'd with cold as she went.


XII.

O'er the path so well known still proceeded the Maid
 Where the Abbey rose dim on the sight,
Thro' the gate-way she entered, she felt not afraid
Yet the ruins were lonely and wild, and their shade
 Seem'd to deepen the gloom of the night.


XIII.

All around her was silent, save when the rude blast
 Howl'd dismally round the old pile;
Over weed-cover'd fragments still fearless she past,
And arrived in the innermost ruin at last
 Where the elder tree grew in the aisle.


XIV.

Well-pleas'd did she reach it, and quickly drew near
 And hastily gather'd the bough:
When the sound of a voice seem'd to rise on her ear,
She paus'd, and she listen'd, all eager to hear,
 Aud her heart panted fearfully now.


XV.

The wind blew, the hoarse ivy shook over her head,
 She listen'd,--nought else could she hear.
The wind ceas'd, her heart sunk in her bosom with dread
For she heard in the ruins distinctly the tread
 Of footsteps approaching her near.


XVI.

Behind a wide column half breathless with fear
 She crept to conceal herself there:
That instant the moon o'er a dark cloud shone clear,
And she saw in the moon-light two ruffians appear
 And between them a corpse did they bear.


XVII.

Then Mary could feel her heart-blood curdle cold!
 Again the rough wind hurried by,--
It blew off the hat of the one, and behold
Even close to the feet of poor Mary it roll'd,--
 She felt, and expected to die.


XVIII.

""Curse the hat!"" he exclaims. ""Nay come on and first hide
 ""The dead body,"" his comrade replies.
She beheld them in safety pass on by her side,
She seizes the hat, fear her courage supplied,
 And fast thro' the Abbey she flies.


XIX.

She ran with wild speed, she rush'd in at the door,
 She gazed horribly eager around,
Then her limbs could support their faint burthen no more,
And exhausted and breathless she sunk on the floor
 Unable to utter a sound.


XX.

Ere yet her pale lips could the story impart,
 For a moment the hat met her view;--
Her eyes from that object convulsively start,
For--oh God what cold horror then thrill'd thro' her heart,
 When the name of her Richard she knew!


XXI.

Where the old Abbey stands, on the common hard by
 His gibbet is now to be seen.
Not far from the road it engages the eye,
The Traveller beholds it, and thinks with a sigh
 Of poor Mary the Maid of the Inn.",Ballad
91,Gilbert Keith Chesterton,"They spoke of Progress spiring round, 
         Of light and Mrs Humphrey Ward-- 
         It is not true to say I frowned, 
         Or ran about the room and roared; 
         I might have simply sat and snored-- 
         I rose politely in the club 
         And said, `I feel a little bored; 
         Will someone take me to a pub?' 

         The new world's wisest did surround 
         Me; and it pains me to record 
         I did not think their views profound, 
         Or their conclusions well assured; 
         The simple life I can't afford, 
         Besides, I do not like the grub-- 
         I want a mash and sausage, `scored'-- 
         Will someone take me to a pub? 

         I know where Men can still be found, 
         Anger and clamorous accord, 
         And virtues growing from the ground, 
         And fellowship of beer and board, 
         And song, that is a sturdy cord, 
         And hope, that is a hardy shrub, 
         And goodness, that is God's last word-- 
         Will someone take me to a pub?

         Prince, Bayard would have smashed his sword

92,Robert William Service,"I took a contract to bury the body of blasphemous Bill MacKie,
Whenever, wherever or whatsoever the manner of death he die--
Whether he die in the light o' day or under the peak-faced moon;
In cabin or dance-hall, camp or dive, mucklucks or patent shoon;
On velvet tundra or virgin peak, by glacier, drift or draw;
In muskeg hollow or canyon gloom, by avalanche, fang or claw;
By battle, murder or sudden wealth, by pestilence, hooch or lead--
I swore on the Book I would follow and look till I found my tombless dead.

For Bill was a dainty kind of cuss, and his mind was mighty sot
On a dinky patch with flowers and grass in a civilized bone-yard lot.
And where he died or how he died, it didn't matter a damn
So long as he had a grave with frills and a tombstone ""epigram"".
So I promised him, and he paid the price in good cheechako coin
(Which the same I blowed in that very night down in the Tenderloin).
Then I painted a three-foot slab of pine: ""Here lies poor Bill MacKie"",
And I hung it up on my cabin wall and I waited for Bill to die.

Years passed away, and at last one day came a squaw with a story strange,
Of a long-deserted line of traps 'way back of the Bighorn range;
Of a little hut by the great divide, and a white man stiff and still,
Lying there by his lonesome self, and I figured it must be Bill.
So I thought of the contract I'd made with him, and I took down from the shelf
The swell black box with the silver plate he'd picked out for hisself;
And I packed it full of grub and ""hooch"", and I slung it on the sleigh;
Then I harnessed up my team of dogs and was off at dawn of day.

You know what it's like in the Yukon wild when it's sixty-nine below;
When the ice-worms wriggle their purple heads through the crust of the pale blue snow;
When the pine-trees crack like little guns in the silence of the wood,
And the icicles hang down like tusks under the parka hood;
When the stove-pipe smoke breaks sudden off, and the sky is weirdly lit,
And the careless feel of a bit of steel burns like a red-hot spit;
When the mercury is a frozen ball, and the frost-fiend stalks to kill--
Well, it was just like that that day when I set out to look for Bill.

Oh, the awful hush that seemed to crush me down on every hand,
As I blundered blind with a trail to find through that blank and bitter land;
Half dazed, half crazed in the winter wild, with its grim heart-breaking woes,
And the ruthless strife for a grip on life that only the sourdough knows!
North by the compass, North I pressed; river and peak and plain
Passed like a dream I slept to lose and I waked to dream again.

River and plain and mighty peak--and who could stand unawed?
As their summits blazed, he could stand undazed at the foot of the throne of God.
North, aye, North, through a land accurst, shunned by the scouring brutes,
And all I heard was my own harsh word and the whine of the malamutes,
Till at last I came to a cabin squat, built in the side of a hill,
And I burst in the door, and there on the floor, frozen to death, lay Bill.

Ice, white ice, like a winding-sheet, sheathing each smoke-grimed wall;
Ice on the stove-pipe, ice on the bed, ice gleaming over all;
Sparkling ice on the dead man's chest, glittering ice in his hair,
Ice on his fingers, ice in his heart, ice in his glassy stare;
Hard as a log and trussed like a frog, with his arms and legs outspread.
I gazed at the coffin I'd brought for him, and I gazed at the gruesome dead,
And at last I spoke: ""Bill liked his joke; but still, goldarn his eyes,
A man had ought to consider his mates in the way he goes and dies.""

Have you ever stood in an Arctic hut in the shadow of the Pole,
With a little coffin six by three and a grief you can't control?
Have you ever sat by a frozen corpse that looks at you with a grin,
And that seems to say: ""You may try all day, but you'll never jam me in""?
I'm not a man of the quitting kind, but I never felt so blue
As I sat there gazing at that stiff and studying what I'd do.
Then I rose and I kicked off the husky dogs that were nosing round about,
And I lit a roaring fire in the stove, and I started to thaw Bill out.

Well, I thawed and thawed for thirteen days, but it didn't seem no good;
His arms and legs stuck out like pegs, as if they was made of wood.
Till at last I said: ""It ain't no use--he's froze too hard to thaw;
He's obstinate, and he won't lie straight, so I guess I got to--saw.""
So I sawed off poor Bill's arms and legs, and I laid him snug and straight
In the little coffin he picked hisself, with the dinky silver plate;
And I came nigh near to shedding a tear as I nailed him safely down;
Then I stowed him away in my Yukon sleigh, and I started back to town.

So I buried him as the contract was in a narrow grave and deep,
And there he's waiting the Great Clean-up, when the Judgment sluice-heads sweep;
And I smoke my pipe and I meditate in the light of the Midnight Sun,
And sometimes I wonder if they was, the awful things I done.
And as I sit and the parson talks, expounding of the Law,
I often think of poor old Bill--and how hard he was to saw.",Ballad
93,Amelia Opie,"Round youthful Henry's restless bed
His weeping friends and parents pressed;
But she who raised his languid head
He loved far more than all the rest.

Fond mutual love their bosoms fired;
And nearly dawned their bridal day,
When every hope at once expired,
For Henry on his death-bed lay.

The fatal truth the sufferer read
In weeping Lucy's downcast eye:
""And must I, must I, then,"" he said,
""Ere thou art mine, my Lucy, die!

""No,...deign to grant my last, last prayer;
'T would soothe thy lover's parting breath,
Wouldst thou with me to church repair,
Ere yet I feel the stroke of death.

""For trust me, love, I shall my life
With something like to joy resign,
If I but once may call thee wife,
And, dying, claim and hail thee mine.""

He ceased: and Lucy checked the thought
That he might at the altar die,....
The prayer with such true love was fraught,
How could she such a prayer deny?

They reached the church....her cheek was wan
With chilling fears of coming woe....
But triumph when the rites began
Lent Henry's cheek a flattering glow.

The nuptial knot was scarcely tied,
When Henry's eye strange lustre fired,
""She's mine! she's mine!"" he faltering cried,
And in that throb of joy expired.",Ballad
94,Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson,"If you were born before yesterday,
Surely you've heard about Tailor Nils, who flaunts him so gay.

If it's more than a week that you've been here,
Surely you've heard how Knut Storedragen got a lesson severe.

Up on the barn of Ola-Per Kviste after a punchin':
""When Nils heaves you again, take with you some luncheon.""

Hans Bugge, he was a man so renowned,
Haunting ghosts of his name spread alarm all around.

""Tailor Nils, where you wish to lie, now declare!
On that spot will I spit and lay your head right there.""--

""Oh, just come up so near, that I know you by the scent!
Think not that by your jaw to earth I shall be bent!""

When first they met, 't was scarce a bout at all,
Neither man was ready yet to try to get a fall.

The second time Hans Bugge slipped his hold.
""Are you tired now, Hans Bugge?  The dance will soon be bold.""

The third time Hans fell headlong, and forth the blood did spurt.
""Why spit you now so much, man?"" -- ""Oh my, that fall did hurt!""--

Saw you a tree casting shadows on new-fallen snow?
Saw you Nils on a maiden smiling glances bestow?

Have you seen Tailor Nils when the dance he commences?
Are you a maiden, then go!--It's too late, when you've lost your senses.",Ballad
95,Robert Southey,"Bright on the mountain's heathy slope
 The day's last splendors shine
And rich with many a radiant hue
 Gleam gayly on the Rhine.

And many a one from Waldhurst's walls
 Along the river stroll'd,
As ruffling o'er the pleasant stream
 The evening gales came cold.

So as they stray'd a swan they saw
 Sail stately up and strong,
And by a silver chain she drew
 A little boat along,

Whose streamer to the gentle breeze
 Long floating fluttered light,
Beneath whose crimson canopy
 There lay reclin'd a knight.

With arching crest and swelling breast
 On sail'd the stately swan
And lightly up the parting tide
 The little boat came on.

And onward to the shore they drew
 And leapt to land the knight,
And down the stream the swan-drawn boat
 Fell soon beyond the sight.

Was never a Maid in Waldhurst's walls
 Might match with Margaret,
Her cheek was fair, her eyes were dark,
 Her silken locks like jet.

And many a rich and noble youth
 Had strove to win the fair,
But never a rich or noble youth
 Could rival Rudiger.

At every tilt and turney he
 Still bore away the prize,
For knightly feats superior still
 And knightly courtesies.

His gallant feats, his looks, his love,
 Soon won the willing fair,
And soon did Margaret become
 The wife of Rudiger.

Like morning dreams of happiness
 Fast roll'd the months away,
For he was kind and she was kind
 And who so blest as they?

Yet Rudiger would sometimes sit
 Absorb'd in silent thought
And his dark downward eye would seem
 With anxious meaning fraught;

But soon he rais'd his looks again
 And smil'd his cares eway,
And mid the hall of gaiety
 Was none like him so gay.

And onward roll'd the waining months,
 The hour appointed came,
And Margaret her Rudiger
 Hail'd with a father's name.

But silently did Rudiger
 The little infant see,
And darkly on the babe he gaz'd
 And very sad was he.

And when to bless the little babe
 The holy Father came,
To cleanse the stains of sin away
 In Christ's redeeming name,

Then did the cheek of Rudiger
 Assume a death-pale hue,
And on his clammy forehead stood
 The cold convulsive dew;

And faltering in his speech he bade
 The Priest the rites delay,
Till he could, to right health restor'd,
 Enjoy the festive day.

When o'er the many-tinted sky
 He saw the day decline,
He called upon his Margaret
 To walk beside the Rhine.

""And we will take the little babe,
 ""For soft the breeze that blows,
""And the wild murmurs of the stream
 ""Will lull him to repose.""

So forth together did they go,
 The evening breeze was mild,
And Rudiger upon his arm
 Did pillow the sweet child.

And many a one from Waldhurst's walls
 Along the banks did roam,
But soon the evening wind came cold,
 And all betook them home.

Yet Rudiger in silent mood
 Along the banks would roam,
Nor aught could Margaret prevail
 To turn his footsteps home.

""Oh turn thee--turn thee Rudiger,
 ""The rising mists behold,
""The evening wind is damp and chill,
 ""The little babe is cold!""

""Now hush thee--hush thee Margaret,
 ""The mists will do no harm,
""And from the wind the little babe
 ""Lies sheltered on my arm.""

""Oh turn thee--turn thee Rudiger,
 ""Why onward wilt thou roam?
""The moon is up, the night is cold,
 ""And we are far from home.""

He answered not, for now he saw
 A Swan come sailing strong,
And by a silver chain she drew
 A little boat along.

To shore they came, and to the boat
 Fast leapt he with the child,
And in leapt Margaret--breathless now
 And pale with fear and wild.

With arching crest and swelling breast
 On sail'd the stately swan,
And lightly down the rapid tide
 The little boat went on.

The full-orb'd moon that beam'd around
 Pale splendor thro' the night,
Cast through the crimson canopy
 A dim-discoloured light.

And swiftly down the hurrying stream
 In silence still they sail,
And the long streamer fluttering fast
 Flapp'd to the heavy gale.

And he was mute in sullen thought
 And she was mute with fear,
Nor sound but of the parting tide
 Broke on the listening ear.

The little babe began to cry
 And waked his mother's care,
""Now give to me the little babe
 ""For God's sake, Rudiger!""

""Now hush thee, hush thee Margaret!
 ""Nor my poor heart distress--
""I do but pay perforce the price
 ""Of former happiness.

""And hush thee too my little babe,
 ""Thy cries so feeble cease:
""Lie still, lie still;--a little while
 ""And thou shalt be at peace.""

So as he spake to land they drew,
 And swift he stept on shore,
And him behind did Margaret
 Close follow evermore.

It was a place all desolate,
 Nor house nor tree was there,
And there a rocky mountain rose
 Barren, and bleak, and bare.

And at its base a cavern yawn'd,
 No eye its depth might view,
For in the moon-beam shining round
 That darkness darker grew.

Cold Horror crept thro' Margaret's blood,
 Her heart it paus'd with fear,
When Rudiger approach'd the cave
 And cried, ""lo I am here!""

A deep sepulchral sound the cave
 Return'd ""lo I am here!""
And black from out the cavern gloom
 Two giant arms appear.

And Rudiger approach'd and held
 The little infant nigh;
Then Margaret shriek'd, and gather'd then
 New powers from agony.

And round the baby fast and firm
 Her trembling arms she folds,
And with a strong convulsive grasp
 The little infant holds.

""Now help me, Jesus!"" loud she cries.
 And loud on God she calls;
Then from the grasp of Rudiger
 The little infant falls.

And now he shriek'd, for now his frame
 The huge black arms clasp'd round,
And dragg'd the wretched Rudiger
 Adown the dark profound.",Ballad

97,William Makepeace Thackeray,"A street there is in Paris famous, 
For which no rhyme our language yields, 
Rue Neuve de petits Champs its name is -  
The New Street of the Little Fields; 
And there's an inn, not rich and splendid, 
But still in comfortable case; 
The which in youth I oft attended, 
To eat a bowl of Bouillabaisse. 

This Bouillabaisse a noble dish is -  
A sort of soup, or broth, or brew, 
Or hotchpotch of all sorts of fishes, 
That Greenwich never could outdo; 
Green herbs, red peppers, muscles, saffern, 
Soles, onions, garlic, roach, and dace; 
All these you eat at Terré's tavern, 
In that one dish of Bouillabaisse. 

Indeed, a rich and savory stew 'tis; 
And true philosophers, methinks, 
Who love all sorts of natural beauties, 
Should love good victuals and good drinks. 
And Cordelier or Benedictine 
Might gladly, sure, his lot embrace, 
Nor find a fast-day too afflicting, 
Which served him up a Bouillabaisse. 

I wonder if the house still there is? 
Yes, here the lamp is as before; 
The smiling, red-cheek'd écaillère is 
Still opening oysters at the door. 
Is Terré still alive and able? 
I recollect his droll grimace; 
He'd come and smile before your table, 
And hoped you like your Bouillabaisse. 

We enter; nothing's changed or older. 
'How's Monsieur Terré, waiter, pray? ' 
The waiter stares and shrugs his shoulder -  
'Monsieur is dead this many a day.' 
'It is the lot of saint and sinner. 
So honest Terré's run his race! ' 
'What will Monsieur require for dinner? ' 
'Say, do you still cook Bouillabaisse? ' 

'Oh, oui, Monsieur,' 's the waiter's answer; 
'Quel vin Monsieur désire-t-il? ' 
Tell me a good one.' 'That I can, sir; 
The Chambertin with yellow seal.' 
'So Terré's gone,' I say, and sink in 
My old accustom'd corner-place; 
'He's done with feasting and with drinking, 
With Burgundy and Bouillabaisse.' 

My old accustom'd corner here is-  
The table still is in the nook; 
Ah! vanished many a busy year is, 
This well-known chair since last I took. 
When first I saw ye, cari luoghi, 
I'd scarce a beard upon my face, 
And now a grizzled, grim old fogy, 
I sit and wait for Bouillabaisse. 

Where are you, old companions trusty 
Of early days, here met to dine? 
Come, waiter! quick, a flagon crusty -  
I'll pledge them in the good old wine. 
The kind old voices and old faces 
My memory can quick retrace; 
Around the board they take their places, 
And share the wine and Bouillabaisse. 

There's Jack has made a wondrous marriage; 
There's laughing Tom is laughing yet; 
There's brave Augustus drives his carriage; 
There's poor old Fred in the Gazette; 
On James's head the grass is growing: 
Good Lord! the world has wagged apace 
Since here we sat the Claret flowing, 
And drank, and ate the Bouillabaisse. 

Ah me! how quick the days are flitting! 
I mind me of a time that's gone, 
When here I'd sit, as now I'm sitting, 
In this same place- but not alone. 
A fair young form was nestled near me, 
A dear, dear face looked fondly up, 
And sweetly spoke and smiled to cheer me. 
-  There's no one now to share my cup. 

........ 

I drink it as the Fates ordain it. 
Come, fill it, and have done with rhymes; 
Fill up the lonely glass, and drain it 
In memory of dear old times. 
Welcome the wine, whate'er the seal is; 
And sit you down and say your grace 
With thankful heart, whate'er the meal is. 
Here comes the smoking Bouillabaisse!",Ballad
98,William Shenstone,"Ye shepherds give ear to my lay, 
And take no more heed of my sheep: 
They have nothing to do but to stray; 
I have nothing to do but to weep. 
Yet do not my folly reprove; 
She was fair -- and my passion begun; 
She smil'd -- and I could not but love; 
She is faithless -- and I am undone. 
Perhaps I was void of all thought: 
Perhaps it was plain to foresee, 
That a nymph so compleat would be sought 
By a swain more engaging than me. 
Ah! love ev'ry hope can inspire; 
It banishes wisdom the while; 
And the lip of the nymph we admire 
Seems for ever adorn'd with a smile. 
She is faithless, and I am undone; 
Ye that witness the woes I endure; 
Let reason instruct you to shun 
What it cannot instruct you to cure. 
Beware how you loiter in vain 
Amid nymphs of an higher degree: 
It is not for me to explain 
How fair, and how fickle they be. 
Alas! from the day that we met, 
What hope of an end to my woes? 
When I cannot endure to forget 
The glance that undid my repose. 
Yet time may diminish the pain: 
The flow'r, and the shrub, and the tree,

Which I rear'd for her pleasure in vain, 
In time may have comfort for me. 
The sweets of a dew-sprinkled rose, 
The sound of a murmuring stream, 
The peace which from solitude flows, 
Henceforth shall be Corydon's theme. 
High transports are shewn to the sight, 
But we are not to find them our own; 
Fate never bestow'd such delight, 
As I with my Phyllis had known. 
O ye woods, spread your branches apace; 
To your deepest recesses I fly; 
I would hide with the beasts of the chace; 
I would vanish from every eye. 
Yet my reed shall resound thro' the grove 
With the same sad complaint it begun; 
How she smil'd, and I could not but love; 
Was faithless, and I am undone!",Ballad
99,Rudyard Kipling,"It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~
 Would sweep the Channel clean,
Wherefore she kept her hatches close
When the merry Channel chops arose,
 To save the bleached marine.
 
She had one bow-gun of a hundred ton,
 And a great stern-gun beside;
They dipped their noses deep in the sea,
They racked their stays and stanchions free
 In the wash of the wind-whipped tide.
 
It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~,
 Fell in with a cruiser light
That carried the dainty Hotchkiss gun
And a pair o' heels wherewith to run
 From the grip of a close-fought fight.
 
She opened fire at seven miles --
 As ye shoot at a bobbing cork --
And once she fired and twice she fired,
Till the bow-gun drooped like a lily tired
 That lolls upon the stalk.
 
""Captain, the bow-gun melts apace,
 The deck-beams break below,
'Twere well to rest for an hour or twain,
And botch the shattered plates again.""
 And he answered, ""Make it so.""
 
She opened fire within the mile --
 As ye shoot at the flying duck --
And the great stern-gun shot fair and true,
With the heave of the ship, to the stainless blue,
 And the great stern-turret stuck.
 
""Captain, the turret fills with steam,
 The feed-pipes burst below --
You can hear the hiss of the helpless ram,
You can hear the twisted runners jam.""
 And he answered, ""Turn and go!""
 
It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~,
 And grimly did she roll;
Swung round to take the cruiser's fire
As the White Whale faces the Thresher's ire
 When they war by the frozen Pole.
 
""Captain, the shells are falling fast,
 And faster still fall we;
And it is not meet for English stock
To bide in the heart of an eight-day clock
 The death they cannot see.""
 
""Lie down, lie down, my bold A.B.,
 We drift upon her beam;
We dare not ram, for she can run;
And dare ye fire another gun,
 And die in the peeling steam?""
 
It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~
 That carried an armour-belt;
But fifty feet at stern and bow
Lay bare as the paunch of the purser's sow,
 To the hail of the ~Nordenfeldt~.
 
""Captain, they hack us through and through;
 The chilled steel bolts are swift!
We have emptied the bunkers in open sea,
Their shrapnel bursts where our coal should be.""
 And he answered, ""Let her drift.""
 
It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~,
 Swung round upon the tide,
Her two dumb guns glared south and north,
And the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth,
 And she ground the cruiser's side.
 
""Captain, they cry, the fight is done,
 They bid you send your sword.""
And he answered, ""Grapple her stern and bow.
They have asked for the steel.  They shall have it now;
 Out cutlasses and board!""
 
It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~
 Spewed up four hundred men;
And the scalded stokers yelped delight,
As they rolled in the waist and heard the fight
 Stamp o'er their steel-walled pen.
 
They cleared the cruiser end to end,
 From conning-tower to hold.
They fought as they fought in Nelson's fleet;
They were stripped to the waist, they were bare to the feet,
 As it was in the days of old.
 
It was the sinking ~Clampherdown~
 Heaved up her battered side --
And carried a million pounds in steel,
To the cod and the corpse-fed conger-eel,
 And the scour of the Channel tide.
 
It was the crew of the ~Clampherdown~
 Stood out to sweep the sea,
On a cruiser won from an ancient foe,
As it was in the days of long ago,
 And as it still shall be.",Ballad
0,Pablo Neruda,"And now you're mine. Rest with your dream in my dream.
Love and pain and work should all sleep, now.
The night turns on its invisible wheels,
and you are pure beside me as a sleeping amber.

No one else, Love, will sleep in my dreams. You will go,
we will go together, over the waters of time.
No one else will travel through the shadows with me,
only you, evergreen, ever sun, ever moon.

Your hands have already opened their delicate fists
and let their soft drifting signs drop away; your eyes closed like two gray
wings, and I move

after, following the folding water you carry, that carries
me away. The night, the world, the wind spin out their destiny.
Without you, I am your dream, only that, and that is all.",Sonnet
1,John Keats,"Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art! - 
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night,
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like Nature's patient sleepless Eremite,
The moving waters at their priestlike task
Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,
Or gazing on the new soft fallen mask
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors - 
No -yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,
Pillowed upon my fair love's ripening breast,
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,
Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,
And so live ever -or else swoon to death.",Sonnet
2,Pablo Neruda,"I crave your mouth, your voice, your hair.
Silent and starving, I prowl through the streets.
Bread does not nourish me, dawn disrupts me, all day
I hunt for the liquid measure of your steps.

I hunger for your sleek laugh,
your hands the color of a savage harvest,
hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails,
I want to eat your skin like a whole almond.

I want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body,
the sovereign nose of your arrogant face,
I want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes,

and I pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight,
hunting for you, for your hot heart,
like a puma in the barrens of Quitratue.",Sonnet
3,Pablo Neruda,"If your eyes were not the color of the moon,
of a day full [here, interrupted by the baby waking -- continued about 26
hours later ]
of a day full of clay, and work, and fire,
if even held-in you did not move in agile grace like the air,
if you were not an amber week,

not the yellow moment
when autumn climbs up through the vines;
if you were not that bread the fragrant moon
kneads, sprinkling its flour across the sky,

oh, my dearest, I could not love you so!
But when I hold you I hold everything that is --
sand, time, the tree of the rain,

everything is alive so that I can be alive:
without moving I can see it all:
in your life I see everything that lives.",Sonnet
4,Edgar Allan Poe,"There are some qualities- some incorporate things,
        That have a double life, which thus is made
      A type of that twin entity which springs
        From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.
      There is a two-fold Silence- sea and shore-
        Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,
        Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,
      Some human memories and tearful lore,
      Render him terrorless: his name's ""No More.""
      He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!
        No power hath he of evil in himself;
      But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)
        Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,
      That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
      No foot of man,) commend thyself to God!",Sonnet
5,John Milton,"How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth, 
Stoln on his wing my three and twentieth year! 
My hasting days fly on wtih full career, 
But my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th. 
Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth, 
That I to manhood am arrived so near, 
And inward ripeness doth much less appear, 
That some more timely-happy spirits endu'th. 
Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow, 
It shall be still in strictest measure even 
To that same lot, however mean or high, 
Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven; 
All is, if I have grace to use it so, 
As ever in my great Taskmaster's eye.",Sonnet
6,John Donne,"Death, be not proud, though some have callèd thee
Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;
For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow
Die not, poor death, nor yet canst thou kill me.
From rest and sleep, which yet thy pictures be,
Much pleasure, then from thee much more, must low
And soonest our best men with thee do go,
Rest of their bones and soul's delivery.
Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings and desperate men
And dost with poison, war and sickness dwell,
And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well
And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then ?
One short sleep past, we wake eternally,
And death shall be no more; death, thou shalt die.",Sonnet
7,Edgar Allan Poe,"Science! true daughter of Old Time thou art!
      Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.
    Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,
      Vulture, whose wings are dull realities?
    How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,
      Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
    To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,
      Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?
    Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?
      And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
    To seek a shelter in some happier star?
      Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,
    The Elfin from the green grass, and from me
    The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?",Sonnet
8,John Donne,"Thou hast made me, and shall thy work decay?
Repair me now, for now mine end doth haste;
I run to death, and death meets me as fast,
And all my pleasures are like yesterday.
I dare not move my dim eyes any way,
Despair behind, and death before doth cast
Such terror, and my feeble flesh doth waste
By sin in it, which it towards hell doth weigh.
Only thou art above, and when towards thee
By thy leave I can look, I rise again;
But our old subtle foe so tempteth me
That not one hour myself I can sustain.
Thy grace may wing me to prevent his art,
And thou like adamant draw mine iron heart.",Sonnet
9,Sir John Suckling,"Dost see how unregarded now
        That piece of beauty passes?
There was a time when I did vow
        To that alone;
    But mark the fate of faces;
The red and white works now no more on me
Than if it could not charm, or I not see.

And yet the face continues good,
        And I have still desires,
Am still the selfsame flesh and blood,
        As apt to melt
    And suffer from those fires;
Oh some kind pow'r unriddle where it lies,
Whether my heart be faulty, or her eyes?

She ev'ry day her man does kill,
        And I as often die;
Neither her power then, nor my will
        Can question'd be.
    What is the mystery?
Sure beauty's empires, like to greater states,
Have certain periods set, and hidden fates.",Sonnet
10,Rupert Brooke,"Somewhile before the dawn I rose, and stept
 Softly along the dim way to your room,
 And found you sleeping in the quiet gloom,
And holiness about you as you slept.
I knelt there; till your waking fingers crept
 About my head, and held it.  I had rest
 Unhoped this side of Heaven, beneath your breast.
I knelt a long time, still; nor even wept.

It was great wrong you did me; and for gain
Of that poor moment's kindliness, and ease,
And sleepy mother-comfort!
                            Child, you know
How easily love leaps out to dreams like these,
Who has seen them true.  And love that's wakened so
Takes all too long to lay asleep again.",Sonnet
11,Edgar Allan Poe,"Fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers,
        Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take!

        At sight of thee and thine at once awake!
      How many scenes of what departed bliss!
        How many thoughts of what entombed hopes!
      How many visions of a maiden that is
        No more- no more upon thy verdant slopes!
      No more! alas, that magical sad sound
        Transforming all! Thy charms shall please no more-
      Thy memory no more! Accursed ground
        Henceforth I hold thy flower-enameled shore,

12,Elizabeth Bishop,"I am in need of music that would flow
Over my fretful, feeling finger-tips,
Over my bitter-tainted, trembling lips,
With melody, deep, clear, and liquid-slow.
Oh, for the healing swaying, old and low,
Of some song sung to rest the tired dead,
A song to fall like water on my head,
And over quivering limbs, dream flushed to glow!

There is a magic made by melody:
A spell of rest, and quiet breath, and cool
Heart, that sinks through fading colors deep
To the subaqueous stillness of the sea,
And floats forever in a moon-green pool,
Held in the arms of rhythm and of sleep.",Sonnet
13,John Donne,"Batter my heart, three-personed God; for You
As yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend;
That I may rise and stand, o'erthrow me,'and bend
Your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new.
I, like an usurped town, to'another due,
Labor to'admit You, but O, to no end;
Reason, Your viceroy'in me, me should defend,
But is captived, and proves weak or untrue.
Yet dearly'I love You,'and would be loved fain,
But am betrothed unto Your enemy.

Except You'enthrall me, never shall be free,
Nor ever chaste, except You ravish me.",Sonnet
15,Federico García Lorca,"Never let me lose the marvel 
of your statue-like eyes, or the accent 
the solitary rose of your breath 
places on my cheek at night.

I am afraid of being, on this shore, 
a branchless trunk, and what I most regret 
is having no flower, pulp, or clay 
for the worm of my despair.

If you are my hidden treasure, 
if you are my cross, my dampened pain, 
if I am a dog, and you alone my master,

never let me lose what I have gained, 
and adorn the branches of your river 
with leaves of my estranged Autumn.",Sonnet
17,John Donne,"Oh my black soul! now art thou summoned
By sickness, death's herald, and champion;
Thou art like a pilgrim, which abroad hath done
Treason, and durst not turn to whence he is fled;
Or like a thief, which till death's doom be read,
Wisheth himself delivered from prison,
But damned and haled to execution,
Wisheth that still he might be imprisoned.
Yet grace, if thou repent, thou canst not lack;
But who shall give thee that grace to begin?
Oh make thy self with holy mourning black,
And red with blushing, as thou art with sin;
Or wash thee in Christ's blood, which hath this might
That being red, it dyes red souls to white.",Sonnet

Lo dì che han detto a' dolci amici addio. - Dante
Amor, con quanto sforzo oggi mi vinci! - Petrarca

Come back to me, who wait and watch for you:--
Or come not yet, for it is over then,
And long it is before you come again,
So far between my pleasures are and few.
While, when you come not, what I do I do
Thinking ""Now when he comes,"" my sweetest when:""
For one man is my world of all the men
This wide world holds; O love, my world is you.
Howbeit, to meet you grows almost a pang
Because the pang of parting comes so soon;
My hope hangs waning, waxing, like a moon
Between the heavenly days on which we meet:
Ah me, but where are now the songs I sang
When life was sweet because you call'd them sweet? 

2 

Era già 1'ora che volge il desio. - Dante
Ricorro al tempo ch' io vi vidi prima. - Petrarca

I wish I could remember that first day,
First hour, first moment of your meeting me,
If bright or dim the season, it might be
Summer or winter for aught I can say;
So unrecorded did it slip away,
So blind was I to see and to foresee,
So dull to mark the budding of my tree
That would not blossom yet for many a May.
If only I could recollect it, such
A day of days! I let it come and go
As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow;
It seem'd to mean so little, meant so much;
If only now I could recall that touch,
First touch of hand in hand--Did one but know! 


3 

O ombre vane, fuor che ne l'aspetto!  - Dante
Immaginata guida la conduce. - Petrarca

I dream of you to wake: would that I might
Dream of you and not wake but slumber on;
Nor find with dreams the dear companion gone,
As summer ended summer birds take flight.
In happy dreams I hold you full in sight,
I blush again who waking look so wan;
Brighter than sunniest day that ever shone,
In happy dreams your smile makes day of night.
Thus only in a dream we are at one,
Thus only in a dream we give and take
The faith that maketh rich who take or give;
If thus to sleep is sweeter than to wake,
To die were surely sweeter than to live,
Though there be nothing new beneath the sun. 


4 

Poca favilla gran fliamma seconda. - Dante
Ogni altra cosa, ogni pensier va fore,
E sol ivi con voi rimansi amore.  - Petrarca

I lov'd you first: but afterwards your love
Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song
As drown'd the friendly cooings of my dove.
Which owes the other most? my love was long,
And yours one moment seem'd to wax more strong;
I lov'd and guess'd at you, you construed me--
And lov'd me for what might or might not be
Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.
For verily love knows not ""mine"" or ""thine;""
With separate ""I"" and ""thou"" free love has done,
For one is both and both are one in love:
Rich love knows nought of ""thine that is not mine;""
Both have the strength and both the length thereof,
Both of us, of the love which makes us one. 


5 

Amor che a nullo amato amar perdona. - Dante
Amor m'addusse in sì gioiosa spene. - Petrarca

O my heart's heart, and you who are to me
More than myself myself, God be with you,
Keep you in strong obedience leal and true
To Him whose noble service setteth free,
Give you all good we see or can foresee,
Make your joys many and your sorrows few,
Bless you in what you bear and what you do,
Yea, perfect you as He would have you be.
So much for you; but what for me, dear friend?
To love you without stint and all I can
Today, tomorrow, world without an end;
To love you much and yet to love you more,
As Jordan at his flood sweeps either shore;
Since woman is the helpmeet made for man. 


6 

Or puoi la quantitate
Comprender de l'amor che a te mi scalda. - Dante
Non vo' che da tal nodo mi scioglia.  - Petrarca

Trust me, I have not earn'd your dear rebuke,
I love, as you would have me, God the most;
Would lose not Him, but you, must one be lost,
Nor with Lot's wife cast back a faithless look
Unready to forego what I forsook;
This say I, having counted up the cost,
This, though I be the feeblest of God's host,
The sorriest sheep Christ shepherds with His crook.
Yet while I love my God the most, I deem
That I can never love you overmuch;
I love Him more, so let me love you too;
Yea, as I apprehend it, love is such
I cannot love you if I love not Him,
I cannot love Him if I love not you. 


7 

Qui primavera sempre ed ogni frutto. - Dante
Ragionando con meco ed io con lui.  - Petrarca

""Love me, for I love you""--and answer me,
""Love me, for I love you""--so shall we stand
As happy equals in the flowering land
Of love, that knows not a dividing sea.
Love builds the house on rock and not on sand,
Love laughs what while the winds rave desperately;
And who hath found love's citadel unmann'd?
And who hath held in bonds love's liberty?
My heart's a coward though my words are brave
We meet so seldom, yet we surely part
So often; there's a problem for your art!
Still I find comfort in his Book, who saith,
Though jealousy be cruel as the grave,
And death be strong, yet love is strong as death. 


8 

Come dicesse a Dio: D'altro non calme.  - Dante
Spero trovar pietà non che perdono.  - Petrarca

""I, if I perish, perish""--Esther spake:
And bride of life or death she made her fair
In all the lustre of her perfum'd hair
And smiles that kindle longing but to slake.
She put on pomp of loveliness, to take
Her husband through his eyes at unaware;
She spread abroad her beauty for a snare,
Harmless as doves and subtle as a snake.
She trapp'd him with one mesh of silken hair,
She vanquish'd him by wisdom of her wit,
And built her people's house that it should stand:--
If I might take my life so in my hand,
And for my love to Love put up my prayer,
And for love's sake by Love be granted it! 


9 

O dignitosa coscienza e netta! - Dante
Spirto più acceso di virtuti ardenti. - Petrarca

Thinking of you, and all that was, and all
That might have been and now can never be,
I feel your honour'd excellence, and see
Myself unworthy of the happier call:
For woe is me who walk so apt to fall,
So apt to shrink afraid, so apt to flee,
Apt to lie down and die (ah, woe is me!)
Faithless and hopeless turning to the wall.
And yet not hopeless quite nor faithless quite,
Because not loveless; love may toil all night,
But take at morning; wrestle till the break
Of day, but then wield power with God and man:--
So take I heart of grace as best I can,
Ready to spend and be spent for your sake. 


10 

Con miglior corso e con migliore stella.  - Dante
La vita fugge e non s'arresta un' ora.  - Petrarca

Time flies, hope flags, life plies a wearied wing;
Death following hard on life gains ground apace;
Faith runs with each and rears an eager face,
Outruns the rest, makes light of everything,
Spurns earth, and still finds breath to pray and sing;
While love ahead of all uplifts his praise,
Still asks for grace and still gives thanks for grace,
Content with all day brings and night will bring.
Life wanes; and when love folds his wings above
Tired hope, and less we feel his conscious pulse,
Let us go fall asleep, dear friend, in peace:
A little while, and age and sorrow cease;
A little while, and life reborn annuls
Loss and decay and death, and all is love. 


11 

Vien dietro a me e lascia dir le genti. - Dante
Contando i casi della vita nostra.  - Petrarca

Many in aftertimes will say of you
""He lov'd her""--while of me what will they say?
Not that I lov'd you more than just in play,
For fashion's sake as idle women do.
Even let them prate; who know not what we knew
Of love and parting in exceeding pain,
Of parting hopeless here to meet again,
Hopeless on earth, and heaven is out of view.
But by my heart of love laid bare to you,
My love that you can make not void nor vain,
Love that foregoes you but to claim anew
Beyond this passage of the gate of death,
I charge you at the Judgment make it plain
My love of you was life and not a breath. 


12 

Amor, che ne la mente mi ragiona. - Dante
Amor vien nel bel viso di costei.  - Petrarca

If there be any one can take my place
And make you happy whom I grieve to grieve,
Think not that I can grudge it, but believe
I do commend you to that nobler grace,
That readier wit than mine, that sweeter face;
Yea, since your riches make me rich, conceive
I too am crown'd, while bridal crowns I weave,
And thread the bridal dance with jocund pace.
For if I did not love you, it might be
That I should grudge you some one dear delight;
But since the heart is yours that was mine own,
Your pleasure is my pleasure, right my right,
Your honourable freedom makes me free,
And you companion'd I am not alone.

E drizzeremo gli occhi al Primo Amore. - Dante
Ma trovo peso non da le mie braccia.  - Petrarca

If I could trust mine own self with your fate,
Shall I not rather trust it in God's hand?
Without Whose Will one lily doth not stand,
Nor sparrow fall at his appointed date;
Who numbereth the innumerable sand,
Who weighs the wind and water with a weight,
To Whom the world is neither small nor great,
Whose knowledge foreknew every plan we plann'd.
Searching my heart for all that touches you,
I find there only love and love's goodwill
Helpless to help and impotent to do,
Of understanding dull, of sight most dim;
And therefore I commend you back to Him
Whose love your love's capacity can fill.

E la Sua Volontade è nostra pace. - Dante
Sol con questi pensier, con altre chiome.  - Petrarca

Youth gone, and beauty gone if ever there
Dwelt beauty in so poor a face as this;
Youth gone and beauty, what remains of bliss?
I will not bind fresh roses in my hair,
To shame a cheek at best but little fair,--
Leave youth his roses, who can bear a thorn,--
I will not seek for blossoms anywhere,
Except such common flowers as blow with corn.
Youth gone and beauty gone, what doth remain?
The longing of a heart pent up forlorn,
A silent heart whose silence loves and longs;
The silence of a heart which sang its songs
While youth and beauty made a summer morn,
Silence of love that cannot sing again.",Sonnet
19,John Donne,"Thou hast made me, and shall thy work decay?
     Repair me now, for now mine end doth haste,
     I run to death, and death meets me as fast,
     And all my pleasures are like yesterday;
     I dare not move my dim eyes any way,
     Despair behind, and death before doth cast
     Such terror, and my feebled flesh doth waste
     By sin in it, which it t'wards hell doth weigh.
     Only thou art above, and when towards thee
   By thy leave I can look, I rise again;
   But our old subtle foe so tempteth me,
   That not one hour I can myself sustain;
   Thy grace may wing me to prevent his art,
   And thou like adamant draw mine iron heart.",Sonnet
20,John Donne,"Since she whom I loved hath paid her last debt
To Nature, and to hers, and my good is dead,
And her soul early into heaven ravished,
Wholly on heavenly things my mind is set.
here the admiring her my mind did whet
To seek thee, God; so streams do show the head;
But though I have found thee, and thou my thirst hast fed,
a holy thristy dropsy melts me yet.
But why should I beg more love, whenas thou
Dost woo my soul, for hers offering all thine:
And dost not only fear lest I allow
My love to saints and angels, things divine,
but in they tender jealousy dost doubt
lest the world, flesh, yea, devil put thee out.",Sonnet
21,George Barker,"Most near, most dear, most loved, and most far,
Under the huge window where I often found her
Sitting as huge as Asia, seismic with laughter,
Gin and chicken helpless in her Irish hand,
Irresistible as Rabelais but most tender for
The lame dogs and hurt birds that surround her,—
She is a procession no one can follow after
But be like a little dog following a brass band.
She will not glance up at the bomber or condescend
To drop her gin and scuttle to a cellar,
But lean on the mahogany table like a mountain
Whom only faith can move, and so I send
O all her faith and all my love to tell her
That she will move from mourning into morning.",Sonnet
22,Tamara Beryl Latham,"If I could write a sonnet 
on a star 
Then bottle it and 
toss it to the sea 
Would it travel 
to the corners of the Earth, 
And echo there 
the love I hold for thee? If I could write a sonnet 
on the moon 
Then bottle it and 
toss it to the winds 
Would it find your heart 
So you may briefly know, 
Where your love ends 
Is where my love begins? If I could write a sonnet 
on the sun 
Then bottle it and 
toss it throughout time 
Would someone from a distant galaxy 
Find no greater love 
Than that was mine Yet, I cannot write a sonnet 
on a star, 
Nor moon, nor even on 
the blazing sun, 
Nor bottle words to send them 
Where you are 
Nor coerce our separate hearts 
To beat as one And so my darling 
You will never hear 
The humble words of love 
I wrote for thee 
They remain encrypted, 
tightly sealed 
And yet they travel 
on eternally",Sonnet
23,Oscar Wilde,"NOT that I love thy children, whose dull eyes
            See nothing save their own unlovely woe,
            Whose minds know nothing, nothing care to know,--
            But that the roar of thy Democracies,
            Thy reigns of Terror, thy great Anarchies,
            Mirror my wildest passions like the sea,--
            And give my rage a brother----! Liberty!
            For this sake only do thy dissonant cries
            Delight my discreet soul, else might all kings
            By bloody knout or treacherous cannonades
            Rob nations of their rights inviolate
            And I remain unmoved--and yet, and yet,

            God knows it I am with them, in some things.",Sonnet
24,John Donne,"I am a little world made cunningly 
Of Elements, and an Angelike spright, 
But black sinne hath betraid to endlesse night 
My worlds both parts, and (oh) both parts must die. 
You which beyond that heaven which was most high 
Have found new sphears, and of new lands can write, 
Powre new seas in mine eyes, that so I might 
Drowne my world with my weeping earnestly, 
Or wash it if it must be drown'd no more; 
But oh it must be burnt! alas the fire 
Of lust and envie have burnt it heretofore, 
And made it fouler; Let their flames retire, 
And burne me o Lord, with a fiery zeale 
Of thee and thy house, which doth in eating heale.",Sonnet
25,John Donne,"Death, be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;
For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow,
Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.
From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,
Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow,
And soonest our best men with thee do go,
Rest of their bones, and soul's delivery.
Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,
And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell;
And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well
And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then?
One short sleep past, we wake eternally,
And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.",Sonnet
26,William Wordsworth,"Scorn not the Sonnet; Critic, you have frowned, 
Mindless of its just honours; with this key 
Shakspeare unlocked his heart; the melody 
Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch's wound; 
A thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound; 
With it Camoens soothed an exile's grief; 
The Sonnet glittered a gay myrtle leaf 
Amid the cypress with which Dante crowned 
His visionary brow: a glow-worm lamp, 
It cheered mild Spenser, called from Faery-land 
To struggle through dark ways; and when a damp 
Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand 
The Thing became a trumpet; whence he blew 
Soul-animating strains--alas, too few!",Sonnet
29,John Donne,"Oh, to vex me, contraryes meet in one: 
Inconstancy unnaturally hath begott 
A constant habit; that when I would not 
I change in vowes, and in devotione. 
As humorous is my contritione 
As my prophane Love, and as soone forgott: 
As ridlingly distemper'd, cold and hott, 
As praying, as mute; as infinite, as none. 
I durst not view heaven yesterday; and to day 
In prayers, and flattering speaches I court God: 
To morrow I quake with true feare of his rod. 
So my devout fitts come and go away 
Like a fantistique Ague: save that here 
Those are my best dayes, when I shake with feare.",Sonnet
30,John Donne,"As due by many titles I resigne 
My selfe to thee, O God, first I was made 
By thee, and for thee, and when I was decay'd 
Thy blood bought that, the which before was thine; 
I am thy sonne, made with thy selfe to shine, 
Thy servant, whose paines thou hast still repaid, 
Thy sheepe, thine Image, and, till I betray'd 
My selfe, a temple of thy Spirit divine; 
Why doth the devill then usurpe on mee? 
Why doth he steale, nay ravish that's thy right? 
Except thou rise and for thine own worke fight, 
Oh I shall soone despaire, when I doe see 
That thou lov'st mankind well, yet wilt'not chuse me, 
And Satan hates mee, yet is loth to lose me.",Sonnet
31,John Donne,"Batter my heart, three-person'd God, for you
As yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend;
That I may rise and stand, o'erthrow me, and bend
Your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new.
I, like an usurp'd town to'another due,
Labor to'admit you, but oh, to no end;
Reason, your viceroy in me, me should defend,
But is captiv'd, and proves weak or untrue.
Yet dearly'I love you, and would be lov'd fain,
But am betroth'd unto your enemy;
Divorce me,'untie or break that knot again,
Take me to you, imprison me, for I,
Except you'enthrall me, never shall be free,
Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me.",Sonnet
32,John Donne,"This is my playes last scene, here heavens appoint 
My pilgrimages last mile; and my race 
Idly, yet quickly runne, hath this last pace, 
My spans last inch, my minutes latest point, 
And gluttonous death, will instantly unjoynt 
My body, and soule, and I shall sleepe a space, 
But my'ever-waking part shall see that face, 
Whose feare already shakes my every joynt; 
Then, as my soule, to'heaven her first seate, takes flight, 
And earth-borne body, in the earth shall dwell, 
So, fall my sinnes, that all may have their right, 
To where they're bred, and would presse me, to hell. 
Impute me righteous, thus purg'd of evill, 
For thus I leave the world, the flesh, the devill.",Sonnet
33,John Donne,"Show me, dear Christ, thy Spouse, so bright and clear.
What! is it She, which on the other shore
Goes richly painted? or which, robbed and tore,
Laments and mourns in Germany and here?
Sleeps she a thousand, then peeps up one year?
Is she self-truth and errs? now new, now outwore?
Doth she, and did she, and shall she evermore
On one, on seven, or on no hill appear?
Dwells she with us, or like adventuring knights
First travail we to seek and then make love?
Betray, kind husband, thy spouse to our sights,
And let mine amorous soul court thy mild dove,
Who is most true and pleasing to thee then
When she's embraced and open to most men.",Sonnet
35,John Donne,"Wilt thou love God, as he thee? then digest, 
My Soule, this wholsome meditation, 
How God the Spirit, by Angels waited on 
In heaven, doth make his Temple in thy brest. 
The Father having begot a Sonne most blest, 
And still begetting, (for he ne'r begonne) 
Hath deign'd to chuse thee by adoption, 
Coheire to his glory, and Sabbaths endlesse rest; 
And as a robb'd man, which by search doth finde 
His stolne stuffe sold, must lose or buy it againe; 
The Sonne of glory came downe, and was slaine, 
Us whom he had made, and Satan stolne, to unbinde. 
'Twas much, that man was made like God before, 
But, that God should be made like man, much more.",Sonnet
36,John Donne,"Spit in my face you Jewes, and pierce my side, 
Buffet, and scoffe, scourge, and crucifie mee, 
For I have sinn'd, and sinn'd, and onely hee, 
Who could do no iniquitie, hath dyed: 
But by my death can not be satisfied 
My sinnes, which passe the Jewes impiety: 
They kill'd once an inglorious man, but I 
Crucifie him daily, being now glorified. 
Oh let mee then, his strange love still admire: 
Kings pardon, but he bore our punishment. 
And Jacob came cloth'd in vile harsh attire 
But to supplant, and with gainfull intent: 
God cloth'd himselfe in vile mans flesh, that so 
Hee might be weake enough to suffer woe.",Sonnet
38,Thomas Gray,"In vain to me the smiling mornings shine,
And redd'ning Phoebus lifts his golden fire:
The birds in vain their amorous descant join;
Or cheerful fields resume their green attire:
These ears, alas! for other notes repine,
A different object do these eyes require:
My lonely anguish melts no heart but mine;
And in my breast the imperfect joys expire.
Yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer,
And new-born pleasure brings to happier men:
The fields to all their wonted tribute bear;
To warm their little loves the birds complain:
I fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear,
And weep the more, because I weep in vain.",Sonnet
39,John Donne,"At the round earths imagin'd corners, blow 
Your trumpets, Angells, and arise, arise 
From death, you numberlesse infinities 
Of soules, and to your scattred bodies goe, 
All whom the flood did, and fire shall o'erthrow, 
All whom warre, dearth, sage, agues, tyrannies, 
Despaire, law chance, hath slaine, and you whose eyes, 
Shall behold God, and never tast deaths woe. 
But let them sleepe, Lord, and mee mourne a space, 
For, if above all these, my sinnes abound, 
'Tis late to aske abundance of thy grace, 
When wee are there; here on this lowly ground, 
Teach mee how to repent; for that's as good 
As if thou'hadst seal'd my pardon, with thy blood.",Sonnet
40,John Donne,"O might those sighes and teares returne againe 
Into my breast and eyes, which I have spent, 
That I might in this holy discontent 
Mourne with some fruit, as I have mourn'd in vaine; 
In mine Idolatry what showres of raine 
Mine eyes did waste? what griefs my heart did rent? 
That sufferance was my sinne; now I repent; 
'Cause I did sufffer I must suffer paine. 
Th'hydroptique drunkard, and night-scouting thiefe, 
The itchy Lecher, and selfe-tickling proud 
Have the remembrance of past joyes, for reliefe 
Of comming ills. To (poore) me is allow'd 
No ease; for, long, yet vehement griefe hath beene 
Th'effect and cause, the punishment and sinne.",Sonnet
41,John Donne,"Father, part of his double interest 
Unto thy kingdome, thy Sonne gives to mee, 
His joynture in the knottie Trinitie 
Hee keepes, and gives to me his deaths conquest. 
This Lambe, whose death, with life the world hath blest, 
Was from the worlds beginning slaine, and he 
Hath made two Wills, which with the Legacie 
Of his and thy kingdome, doe thy Sonnes invest. 
Yet such are thy laws, that men argue yet 
Whether a man those statutes can fulfill; 
None doth; but all-healing grace and spirit 
Revive againe what law and letter kill. 
Thy lawes abridgement, and thy last command 
Is all but love; Oh let this last Will stand!",Sonnet
46,John Donne,"Why are wee by all creatures waited on? 
Why doe the prodigall elements supply 
Life and food to mee, being more pure than I, 
Simple, and further from corruption? 
Why brook'st thou, ignorant horse, subjection? 
Why dost thou bull, and bore so seelily 
Dissemble weaknesse, and by one mans stroke die, 
Whose whole kinde, you might swallow and feed upon? 
Weaker I am, woe is mee, and worse than you, 
You have not sinn'd, nor need be timorous. 
But wonder at a greater wonder, for to us 
Created nature doth these things subdue, 
But their Creator, whom sin, nor nature tyed, 
For us, his Creatures, and his foes, hath dyed.",Sonnet
47,John Donne,"If faithfull soules be alike glorifi'd 
As Angels, then my fathers soul doth see, 
And adds this even to full felecitie, 
That valiantly I hels wide mouth o'stride: 
But if our mindes to these soules be descry'd 
By circumstances, and by signes that be 
Apparent in us, not immediately, 
How shall my mindes white truth by them be try'd? 
They see idolatrous lovers weepe and mourne, 
And vile blasphemous Conjurers to call 
On Jesus name, and Pharisaicall 
Dissemblers feigne devotion. Then turne 
O pensive soule, to God, for he knows best 
Thy true griefe, for he put it in my breast.",Sonnet
50,John Milton,"O nightingale that on yon blooming spray 
Warblest at eve, when all the woods are still, 
Thou with fresh hopes the Lover’s heart dost fill, 
While the jolly Hours lead on propitious May. 
Thy liquid notes that close the eye of Day,
First heard before the shallow cuckoo’s bill, 
Portend success in love. O if Jove’s will 
Have linked that amorous power to thy soft lay, 
Now timely sing, ere the rude bird of hate 
Foretell my hopeless doom, in some grove nigh;
As thou from year to year hast sung too late 
For my relief, yet had’st no reason why. 
Whether the Muse or Love call thee his mate, 
Both them I serve, and of their train am I.",Sonnet
51,John Donne,"What if this present were the worlds last night? 
Marke in my heart, O Soule, where thou dost dwell, 
The picture of Christ crucified, and tell 
Whether that countenance can thee affright, 
Teares in his eyes quench the amazing light, 
Blood fills his frownes, which from his pierc'd head fell. 
And can that tongue adjudge thee unto hell, 
Which pray'd forgiveness for his foes fierce spight? 
No, no; but as in my idolatrie 
I said to all my profane mistresses, 
Beauty, of pitty, foulnesse onely is 
A sign of rigour: so I say to thee, 
To wicked spirits are horrid shapes assign'd, 
This beauteous forme assures a pitious minde.",Sonnet
53,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,"Dear native Brook! wild Streamlet of the West!
How many various-fated years have past,
What happy and what mournful hours, since last
I skimm'd the smooth thin stone along thy breast,
Numbering its light leaps! yet so deep imprest
Sink the sweet scenes of childhood, that mine eyes
I never shut amid the sunny ray,
But straight with all their tints thy waters rise,
Thy crossing plank, thy marge with willows grey,
And bedded sand that vein'd with various dyes
Gleam'd through thy bright transparence! On my way,
Visions of Childhood! oft have ye beguil'd
Lone manhood's cares, yet waking fondest sighs:
Ah! that once more I were a careless Child!",Sonnet
54,John Keats,"Haydon! forgive me that I cannot speak
Definitively of these mighty things; 
Forgive me, that I have not eagle's wings,
That what I want I know not where to seek,
And think that I would not be over-meek,
In rolling out upfollowed thunderings,
Even to the steep of Heliconian springs,
Were I of ample strength for such a freak.
Think, too, that all these numbers should be thine; 
Whose else? In this who touch thy vesture's hem? 
For, when men stared at what was most divine
With brainless idiotism and o'erwise phlegm,
Thou hadst beheld the full Hesperian shine
Of their star in the east, and gone to worship them!",Sonnet

          For here the air is horrid with men's groans,
          The priests who call upon thy name are slain,
          Dost thou not hear the bitter wail of pain
          From those whose children lie upon the stones?
          Come down, O Son of God! incestuous gloom
          Curtains the land, and through the starless night

70,George Santayana,"O world, thou choosest not the better part!
It is not wisdom to be only wise,
And on the inward vision close the eyes,
But it is wisdom to believe the heart.
Columbus found a world, and had no chart,
Save one that faith deciphered in the skies;
To trust the soul's invincible surmise
Was all his science and his only art.

Our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine
That lights the pathway but one step ahead
Across a void of mystery and dread.
Bid, then, the tender light of faith to shine

Unto the thinking of the thought divine.",Sonnet

Memorial from the Soul's eternity 
To one dead deathless hour. Look that it be, 
Whether for lustral rite or dire portent, 
Of its own arduous fulness reverent: 
Carve it in ivory or in ebony, 
As Day or Night may rule; and let Time see 
Its flowering crest impearled and orient.

A Sonnet is a coin: its face reveals 
The soul, -- its converse, to what Power 'tis due: -- 
Whether for tribute to the august appeals 
Of Life, or dower in Love's high retinue, 
It serve, or, 'mid the dark wharf's cavernous breath, 
In Charon's palm it pay the toll of Death.",Sonnet

Seeing the game from him escapt away:
sits downe to rest him in some shady place,
with panting hounds beguiled of their pray.
So after long pursuit and vaine assay,
when I all weary had the chace forsooke,
the gentle deare returnd the selfe-same way,
thinking to quench her thirst at the next brooke.
There she beholding me with mylder looke,
sought not to fly, but fearelesse still did bide:
till I in hand her yet halfe trembling tooke,

Strange thing me seemed to see a beast so wyld,

88,Rupert Brooke,"I said I splendidly loved you; it's not true.
 Such long swift tides stir not a land-locked sea.
On gods or fools the high risk falls -- on you --
 The clean clear bitter-sweet that's not for me.
Love soars from earth to ecstasies unwist.
 Love is flung Lucifer-like from Heaven to Hell.
But -- there are wanderers in the middle mist,
 Who cry for shadows, clutch, and cannot tell
Whether they love at all, or, loving, whom:
 An old song's lady, a fool in fancy dress,
Or phantoms, or their own face on the gloom;
 For love of Love, or from heart's loneliness.
Pleasure's not theirs, nor pain.  They doubt, and sigh,
 And do not love at all.  Of these am I.",Sonnet
90,Oscar Wilde,"Nay, Lord, not thus! white lilies in the spring,
Sad olive-groves, or silver-breasted dove,
Teach me more clearly of Thy life and love
Than terrors of red flame and thundering.
The hillside vines dear memories of Thee bring:
A bird at evening flying to its nest
Tells me of One who had no place of rest:
I think it is of Thee the sparrows sing.
Come rather on some autumn afternoon,
When red and brown are burnished on the leaves,
And the fields echo to the gleaner's song,
Come when the splendid fulness of the moon
Looks down upon the rows of golden sheaves,
And reap Thy harvest: we have waited long.",Sonnet
92,Edmund Spenser,"HAppy ye leaues when as those lilly hands,
which hold my life in their dead doing might

lyke captiues trembling at the victors sight.
And happy lines, on which with starry light,
those lamping eyes will deigne sometimes to look
and reade the sorrowes of my dying spright,
written with teares in harts close bleeding book.
And happy rymes bath'd in the sacred brooke,
of Helicon whence she deriued is,
when ye behold that Angels blessed looke,
my soules long lacked foode, my heauens blis.

99,William Allingham,"Now Autumn's fire burns slowly along the woods, 
And day by day the dead leaves fall and melt, 
And night by night the monitory blast 
Wails in the key-hold, telling how it pass'd 
O'er empty fields, or upland solitudes, 
Or grim wide wave; and now the power is felt 
Of melancholy, tenderer in its moods 
Than any joy indulgent summer dealt. 
Dear friends, together in the glimmering eve, 
Pensive and glad, with tones that recognise 
The soft invisible dew in each one's eyes, 
It may be, somewhat thus we shall have leave 
To walk with memory,--when distant lies 
Poor Earth, where we were wont to live and grieve.",Sonnet
0,Helen Hunt Jackson,"O Winter! frozen pulse and heart of fire, 
What loss is theirs who from thy kingdom turn 
Dismayed, and think thy snow a sculptured urn 
Of death! Far sooner in midsummer tire 
The streams than under ice. June could not hire 
Her roses to forego the strength they learn 
In sleeping on thy breast. No fires can burn 
The bridges thou dost lay where men desire 
In vain to build. 
O Heart, when Love's sun goes 
To northward, and the sounds of singing cease, 
Keep warm by inner fires, and rest in peace. 
Sleep on content, as sleeps the patient rose. 
Walk boldly on the white untrodden snows, 
The winter is the winter's own release.",Sonnet
1,Helen Hunt Jackson,"The month of carnival of all the year, 
When Nature lets the wild earth go its way, 
And spend whole seasons on a single day. 
The spring-time holds her white and purple dear; 
October, lavish, flaunts them far and near; 
The summer charily her reds doth lay 
Like jewels on her costliest array; 
October, scornful, burns them on a bier. 
The winter hoards his pearls of frost in sign 
Of kingdom: whiter pearls than winter knew, 
Oar empress wore, in Egypt's ancient line, 
October, feasting 'neath her dome of blue, 
Drinks at a single draught, slow filtered through 
Sunshiny air, as in a tingling wine!",Sonnet

   Love, though for this you riddle me with darts, 
   And drag me at your chariot till I die, -- 
   Oh, heavy prince! Oh, panderer of hearts! -- 
   Yet hear me tell how in their throats they lie 
   Who shout you mighty: thick about my hair, 
   Day in, day out, your ominous arrows purr,  
   Who still am free, unto no querulous care 
   A fool, and in no temple worshiper! 
   I, that have bared me to your quiver's fire, 

  Lifted my face into its puny rain, 

  Do wreathe you Impotent to Evoke Desire 

  As you are Powerless to Elicit Pain! 

  (Now will the god, for blasphemy so brave, 

  Punish me, surely, with the shaft I crave!)  II2.
   I think I should have loved you presently, 
   And given in earnest words I flung in jest; 
   And lifted honest eyes for you to see, 
   And caught your hand against my cheek and breast; 
   And all my pretty follies flung aside 
   That won you to me, and beneath your gaze, 
   Naked of reticence and shorn of pride, 
   Spread like a chart my little wicked ways. 
   I, that had been to you, had you remained, 

  But one more waking from a recurrent dream, 

  Cherish no less the certain stakes I gained, 

  And walk your memory's halls, austere, supreme, 

  A ghost in marble of a girl you knew 

  Who would have loved you in a day or two. III3.
   Oh, think not I am faithful to a vow! 
   Faithless am I save to love's self alone. 
   Were you not lovely I would leave you now: 
   After the feet of beauty fly my own. 
   Were you not still my hunger's rarest food, 
   And water ever to my wildest thirst, 
   I would desert you -- think not but I would! -- 
   And seek another as I sought you first. 
   But you are mobile as the veering air, 

  And all your charms more changeful than the tide, 

  Wherefore to be inconstant is no care: 

  I have but to continue at your side. 

  So wanton, light and false, my love, are you, 

  I am most faithless when I most am true. IV4.
  I shall forget you presently, my dear, 
  So make the most of this, your little day, 
  Your little month, your little half a year, 
  Ere I forget, or die, or move away, 
  And we are done forever; by and by 
  I shall forget you, as I said, but now, 
  If you entreat me with your loveliest lie 
  I will protest you with my favorite vow. 
  I would indeed that love were longer-lived, 

  And vows were not so brittle as they are, 

  But so it is, and nature has contrived 

  To struggle on without a break thus far, -- 

  Whether or not we find what we are seeking 

  Is idle, biologically speaking.",Sonnet
3,Helen Hunt Jackson,"No days such honored days as these! While yet 
Fair Aphrodite reigned, men seeking wide 
For some fair thing which should forever bide 
On earth, her beauteous memory to set 
In fitting frame that no age could forget, 
Her name in lovely April's name did hide, 
And leave it there, eternally allied 
To all the fairest flowers Spring did beget. 
And when fair Aphrodite passed from earth, 
Her shrines forgotten and her feasts of mirth, 
A holier symbol still in seal and sign, 
Sweet April took, of kingdom most divine, 
When Christ ascended, in the time of birth 
Of spring anemones, in Palestine.",Sonnet
4,Helen Hunt Jackson,"This is the treacherous month when autumn days 
With summer's voice come bearing summer's gifts. 
Beguiled, the pale down-trodden aster lifts 
Her head and blooms again. The soft, warm haze 
Makes moist once more the sere and dusty ways, 
And, creeping through where dead leaves lie in drifts, 
The violet returns. Snow noiseless sifts 
Ere night, an icy shroud, which morning's rays 
Willidly shine upon and slowly melt, 
Too late to bid the violet live again. 
The treachery, at last, too late, is plain; 
Bare are the places where the sweet flowers dwelt. 
What joy sufficient hath November felt? 
What profit from the violet's day of pain?",Sonnet
5,Edna St. Vincent Millay,"Only until this cigarette is ended,
A little moment at the end of all,
While on the floor the quiet ashes fall,
And in the firelight to a lance extended,
Bizarrely with the jazzing music blended,
The broken shadow dances on the wall,
I will permit my memory to recall
The vision of you, by all my dreams attended.
And then adieu,—farewell!—the dream is done.
Yours is a face of which I can forget
The color and the features, every one,
The words not ever, and the smiles not yet;
But in your day this moment is the sun
Upon a hill, after the sun has set.",Sonnet
6,Helen Hunt Jackson,"O golden month! How high thy gold is heaped! 
The yellow birch-leaves shine like bright coins strung 
On wands; the chestnut's yellow pennons tongue 
To every wind its harvest challenge. Steeped 
In yellow, still lie fields where wheat was reaped; 
And yellow still the corn sheaves, stacked among 
The yellow gourds, which from the earth have wrung 
Her utmost gold. To highest boughs have leaped 
The purple grape,--last thing to ripen, late 
By very reason of its precious cost. 
O Heart, remember, vintages are lost 
If grapes do not for freezing night-dews wait. 
Think, while thou sunnest thyself in Joy's estate, 
Mayhap thou canst not ripen without frost!",Sonnet

Lo dì che han detto a' dolci amici addio. - Dante
Amor, con quanto sforzo oggi mi vinci! - Petrarca

Come back to me, who wait and watch for you:--
Or come not yet, for it is over then,
And long it is before you come again,
So far between my pleasures are and few.
While, when you come not, what I do I do
Thinking ""Now when he comes,"" my sweetest when:""
For one man is my world of all the men
This wide world holds; O love, my world is you.
Howbeit, to meet you grows almost a pang
Because the pang of parting comes so soon;
My hope hangs waning, waxing, like a moon
Between the heavenly days on which we meet:
Ah me, but where are now the songs I sang
When life was sweet because you call'd them sweet? 

2 

Era già 1'ora che volge il desio. - Dante
Ricorro al tempo ch' io vi vidi prima. - Petrarca

I wish I could remember that first day,
First hour, first moment of your meeting me,
If bright or dim the season, it might be
Summer or winter for aught I can say;
So unrecorded did it slip away,
So blind was I to see and to foresee,
So dull to mark the budding of my tree
That would not blossom yet for many a May.
If only I could recollect it, such
A day of days! I let it come and go
As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow;
It seem'd to mean so little, meant so much;
If only now I could recall that touch,
First touch of hand in hand--Did one but know! 


3 

O ombre vane, fuor che ne l'aspetto!  - Dante
Immaginata guida la conduce. - Petrarca

I dream of you to wake: would that I might
Dream of you and not wake but slumber on;
Nor find with dreams the dear companion gone,
As summer ended summer birds take flight.
In happy dreams I hold you full in sight,
I blush again who waking look so wan;
Brighter than sunniest day that ever shone,
In happy dreams your smile makes day of night.
Thus only in a dream we are at one,
Thus only in a dream we give and take
The faith that maketh rich who take or give;
If thus to sleep is sweeter than to wake,
To die were surely sweeter than to live,
Though there be nothing new beneath the sun. 


4 

Poca favilla gran fliamma seconda. - Dante
Ogni altra cosa, ogni pensier va fore,
E sol ivi con voi rimansi amore.  - Petrarca

I lov'd you first: but afterwards your love
Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song
As drown'd the friendly cooings of my dove.
Which owes the other most? my love was long,
And yours one moment seem'd to wax more strong;
I lov'd and guess'd at you, you construed me--
And lov'd me for what might or might not be
Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.
For verily love knows not ""mine"" or ""thine;""
With separate ""I"" and ""thou"" free love has done,
For one is both and both are one in love:
Rich love knows nought of ""thine that is not mine;""
Both have the strength and both the length thereof,
Both of us, of the love which makes us one. 


5 

Amor che a nullo amato amar perdona. - Dante
Amor m'addusse in sì gioiosa spene. - Petrarca

O my heart's heart, and you who are to me
More than myself myself, God be with you,
Keep you in strong obedience leal and true
To Him whose noble service setteth free,
Give you all good we see or can foresee,
Make your joys many and your sorrows few,
Bless you in what you bear and what you do,
Yea, perfect you as He would have you be.
So much for you; but what for me, dear friend?
To love you without stint and all I can
Today, tomorrow, world without an end;
To love you much and yet to love you more,
As Jordan at his flood sweeps either shore;
Since woman is the helpmeet made for man. 


6 

Or puoi la quantitate
Comprender de l'amor che a te mi scalda. - Dante
Non vo' che da tal nodo mi scioglia.  - Petrarca

Trust me, I have not earn'd your dear rebuke,
I love, as you would have me, God the most;
Would lose not Him, but you, must one be lost,
Nor with Lot's wife cast back a faithless look
Unready to forego what I forsook;
This say I, having counted up the cost,
This, though I be the feeblest of God's host,
The sorriest sheep Christ shepherds with His crook.
Yet while I love my God the most, I deem
That I can never love you overmuch;
I love Him more, so let me love you too;
Yea, as I apprehend it, love is such
I cannot love you if I love not Him,
I cannot love Him if I love not you. 


7 

Qui primavera sempre ed ogni frutto. - Dante
Ragionando con meco ed io con lui.  - Petrarca

""Love me, for I love you""--and answer me,
""Love me, for I love you""--so shall we stand
As happy equals in the flowering land
Of love, that knows not a dividing sea.
Love builds the house on rock and not on sand,
Love laughs what while the winds rave desperately;
And who hath found love's citadel unmann'd?
And who hath held in bonds love's liberty?
My heart's a coward though my words are brave
We meet so seldom, yet we surely part
So often; there's a problem for your art!
Still I find comfort in his Book, who saith,
Though jealousy be cruel as the grave,
And death be strong, yet love is strong as death. 


8 

Come dicesse a Dio: D'altro non calme.  - Dante
Spero trovar pietà non che perdono.  - Petrarca

""I, if I perish, perish""--Esther spake:
And bride of life or death she made her fair
In all the lustre of her perfum'd hair
And smiles that kindle longing but to slake.
She put on pomp of loveliness, to take
Her husband through his eyes at unaware;
She spread abroad her beauty for a snare,
Harmless as doves and subtle as a snake.
She trapp'd him with one mesh of silken hair,
She vanquish'd him by wisdom of her wit,
And built her people's house that it should stand:--
If I might take my life so in my hand,
And for my love to Love put up my prayer,
And for love's sake by Love be granted it! 


9 

O dignitosa coscienza e netta! - Dante
Spirto più acceso di virtuti ardenti. - Petrarca

Thinking of you, and all that was, and all
That might have been and now can never be,
I feel your honour'd excellence, and see
Myself unworthy of the happier call:
For woe is me who walk so apt to fall,
So apt to shrink afraid, so apt to flee,
Apt to lie down and die (ah, woe is me!)
Faithless and hopeless turning to the wall.
And yet not hopeless quite nor faithless quite,
Because not loveless; love may toil all night,
But take at morning; wrestle till the break
Of day, but then wield power with God and man:--
So take I heart of grace as best I can,
Ready to spend and be spent for your sake. 


10 

Con miglior corso e con migliore stella.  - Dante
La vita fugge e non s'arresta un' ora.  - Petrarca

Time flies, hope flags, life plies a wearied wing;
Death following hard on life gains ground apace;
Faith runs with each and rears an eager face,
Outruns the rest, makes light of everything,
Spurns earth, and still finds breath to pray and sing;
While love ahead of all uplifts his praise,
Still asks for grace and still gives thanks for grace,
Content with all day brings and night will bring.
Life wanes; and when love folds his wings above
Tired hope, and less we feel his conscious pulse,
Let us go fall asleep, dear friend, in peace:
A little while, and age and sorrow cease;
A little while, and life reborn annuls
Loss and decay and death, and all is love. 


11 

Vien dietro a me e lascia dir le genti. - Dante
Contando i casi della vita nostra.  - Petrarca

Many in aftertimes will say of you
""He lov'd her""--while of me what will they say?
Not that I lov'd you more than just in play,
For fashion's sake as idle women do.
Even let them prate; who know not what we knew
Of love and parting in exceeding pain,
Of parting hopeless here to meet again,
Hopeless on earth, and heaven is out of view.
But by my heart of love laid bare to you,
My love that you can make not void nor vain,
Love that foregoes you but to claim anew
Beyond this passage of the gate of death,
I charge you at the Judgment make it plain
My love of you was life and not a breath. 


12 

Amor, che ne la mente mi ragiona. - Dante
Amor vien nel bel viso di costei.  - Petrarca

If there be any one can take my place
And make you happy whom I grieve to grieve,
Think not that I can grudge it, but believe
I do commend you to that nobler grace,
That readier wit than mine, that sweeter face;
Yea, since your riches make me rich, conceive
I too am crown'd, while bridal crowns I weave,
And thread the bridal dance with jocund pace.
For if I did not love you, it might be
That I should grudge you some one dear delight;
But since the heart is yours that was mine own,
Your pleasure is my pleasure, right my right,
Your honourable freedom makes me free,
And you companion'd I am not alone. 


13 

E drizzeremo gli occhi al Primo Amore. - Dante
Ma trovo peso non da le mie braccia.  - Petrarca

If I could trust mine own self with your fate,
Shall I not rather trust it in God's hand?
Without Whose Will one lily doth not stand,
Nor sparrow fall at his appointed date;
Who numbereth the innumerable sand,
Who weighs the wind and water with a weight,
To Whom the world is neither small nor great,
Whose knowledge foreknew every plan we plann'd.
Searching my heart for all that touches you,
I find there only love and love's goodwill
Helpless to help and impotent to do,
Of understanding dull, of sight most dim;
And therefore I commend you back to Him
Whose love your love's capacity can fill. 


14 

E la Sua Volontade è nostra pace. - Dante
Sol con questi pensier, con altre chiome.  - Petrarca

Youth gone, and beauty gone if ever there
Dwelt beauty in so poor a face as this;
Youth gone and beauty, what remains of bliss?
I will not bind fresh roses in my hair,
To shame a cheek at best but little fair,--
Leave youth his roses, who can bear a thorn,--
I will not seek for blossoms anywhere,
Except such common flowers as blow with corn.
Youth gone and beauty gone, what doth remain?
The longing of a heart pent up forlorn,
A silent heart whose silence loves and longs;
The silence of a heart which sang its songs
While youth and beauty made a summer morn,
Silence of love that cannot sing again.",Sonnet
9,Rainer Maria Rilke,"Be ahead of all parting, as though it already were
behind you, like the winter that has just gone by.
For among these winters there is one so endlessly winter
that only by wintering through it all will your heart survive.

Be forever dead in Eurydice-more gladly arise
into the seamless life proclaimed in your song.
Here, in the realm of decline, among momentary days,
be the crystal cup that shattered even as it rang.

Be-and yet know the great void where all things begin,
the infinite source of your own most intense vibration,
so that, this once, you may give it your perfect assent.

To all that is used-up, and to all the muffled and dumb
creatures in the world's full reserve, the unsayable sums,
joyfully add yourself, and cancel the count.

10,Helen Hunt Jackson,"The lakes of ice gleam bluer than the lakes 
Of water 'neath the summer sunshine gleamed: 
Far fairer than when placidly it streamed, 
The brook its frozen architecture makes, 
And under bridges white its swift way takes. 
Snow comes and goes as messenger who dreamed 
Might linger on the road; or one who deemed 
His message hostile gently for their sakes 
Who listened might reveal it by degrees. 
We gird against the cold of winter wind 
Our loins now with mighty bands of sleep, 
In longest, darkest nights take rest and ease, 
And every shortening day, as shadows creep 
O'er the brief noontide, fresh surprises find.",Sonnet
11,Helen Hunt Jackson,"Some flowers are withered and some joys have died; 
The garden reeks with an East Indian scent 
From beds where gillyflowers stand weak and spent; 
The white heat pales the skies from side to side; 
But in still lakes and rivers, cool, content, 
Like starry blooms on a new firmament, 
White lilies float and regally abide. 
In vain the cruel skies their hot rays shed; 
The lily does not feel their brazen glare. 
In vain the pallid clouds refuse to share 
Their dews, the lily feels no thirst, no dread. 
Unharmed she lifts her queenly face and head; 
She drinks of living waters and keeps fair.",Sonnet
12,Rainer Maria Rilke,"A tree ascended there. Oh pure transendence!
Oh Orpheus sings! Oh tall tree in the ear!
And all things hushed. Yet even in that silence
a new beginning, beckoning, change appeared.

Creatures of stillness crowded from the bright
unbound forest, out of their lairs and nests;
and it was not from any dullness, not
from fear, that they were so quiet in themselves,

but from just listening. Bellow, roar, shriek
seemed small inside their hearts. And where there had been
at most a makeshift hut to receive the music,

a shelter nailed up out of their darkest longing,
with an entryway that shuddered in the wind-
you built a temple deep inside their hearing.

13,Rainer Maria Rilke,"Breathing: you invisible poem! Complete
interchange of our own
essence with world-space. You counterweight
in which I rythmically happen.

Single wave-motion whose
gradual sea I am:
you, most inclusive of all our possible seas-
space has grown warm.

How many regions in space have already been
inside me. There are winds that seem like
my wandering son.

Do you recognize me, air, full of places I once absorbed?
You who were the smooth bark,
roundness, and leaf of my words.

15,Edna St. Vincent Millay,"When I too long have looked upon your face,
Wherein for me a brightness unobscured
Save by the mists of brightness has its place,
And terrible beauty not to be endured,
I turn away reluctant from your light,
And stand irresolute, a mind undone,
A silly, dazzled thing deprived of sight
From having looked too long upon the sun.
Then is my daily life a narrow room
In which a little while, uncertainly,
Surrounded by impenetrable gloom,
Among familiar things grown strange to me
Making my way, I pause, and feel, and hark,
Till I become accustomed to the dark.",Sonnet
16,Rainer Maria Rilke,"Though the world keeps changing its form
as fast as a cloud, still
what is accomplished falls home
to the Primeval.

Over the change and the passing,
larger and freer,
soars your eternal song,
god with the lyre.

Never has grief been possesed,
never has love been learned,
and what removes us in death

is not revealed.
Only the song through the land
hallows and heals.

17,Helen Hunt Jackson,"Silence again. The glorious symphony 
Hath need of pause and interval of peace. 
Some subtle signal bids all sweet sounds cease, 
Save hum of insects' aimless industry. 
Pathetic summer seeks by blazonry 
Of color to conceal her swift decrease. 
Weak subterfuge! Each mocking day doth fleece 
A blossom, and lay bare her poverty. 
Poor middle-aged summer! Vain this show! 
Whole fields of Golden-Rod cannot offset 
One meadow with a single violet; 
And well the singing thrush and lily know, 
Spite of all artifice which her regret 
Can deck in splendid guise, their time to go!",Sonnet

Has many sonnets: so here now shall be 
One sonnet more, a love sonnet, from me 
To her whose heart is my heart's quiet home, 
To my first Love, my Mother, on whose knee 
I learnt love-lore that is not troublesome; 
Whose service is my special dignity, 
And she my loadstare while I go and come 
And so because you love me, and because 
I love you, Mother, I have woven a wreath

Of time and change and mortal life and death.",Sonnet

Well, such you are,—but well enough we know
How thick about us root, how rankly grow

That flourish through neglect, and soon must send
Perfume too sweet upon us and overthrow
Our steady senses; how such matters go
We are aware, and how such matters end.
Yet shall be told no meagre passion here;
With lovers such as we forevermore
Isolde drinks the draught, and Guinevere
Receives the Table's ruin through her door,
Francesca, with the loud surf at her ear,
Lets fall the colored book upon the floor.",Sonnet

The month of war,--as if in their fierce ways 
Were any month of peace!--in thy rough days 
I find no war in Nature, though the wild 
Winds clash and clang, and broken boughs are piled 
As feet of writhing trees. The violets raise 
Their heads without affright, without amaze, 
And sleep through all the din, as sleeps a child. 
And he who watches well may well discern 
Sweet expectation in each living thing. 
Like pregnant mother the sweet earth doth yearn; 
In secret joy makes ready for the spring; 
And hidden, sacred, in her breast doth bear 
Annunciation lilies for the year.",Sonnet
21,Rainer Maria Rilke,"Call to me to the one among your moments
that stands against you, ineluctably:
intimate as a dog's imploring glance
but, again, forever, turned away

when you think you've captured it at last.
What seems so far from you is most your own.
We are already free, and were dismissed
where we thought we soon would be at home.

Anxious, we keep longing for a foothold-
we, at times too young for what is old
and too old for what has never been;

doing justice only where we praise,
because we are the branch, the iron blade,
and sweet danger, ripening from within.

22,Rainer Maria Rilke,"O you tender ones, walk now and then
into the breath that blows coldly past,
Upon your cheeks let it tremble and part;
behind you it will tremble together again.

O you blessed ones, you who are whole,
you who seem the beginning of hearts,
bows for the arrows and arrows' targets--
tear-bright, your lips more eternally smile.

Don't be afraid to suffer; return
that heaviness to the earth's own weight;
heavy are the mountains, heavy the seas.

Even the small trees you planted as children
have long since become too heavy; you could not
carry them now. But the winds...But the spaces....

   name
I didn't know, you who so early were taken away:
I will once more call up your image and show it to them,
beautiful companion of the unsubduable cry.

Dancer whose body filled with your hesitant fate,
pausing, as though your young flesh had been cast in bronze;
grieving and listening--. Then, from the high dominions,
unearthly music fell into your altered heart.

Already possessed by shadows, with illness near,
your blood flowed darkly; yet, though for a moment
   suspicious,
it burst out into the natural pulses of spring.

Again and again interrupted by downfall and darkness,
earthly, it gleamed. Till, after a terrible pounding,
it entered the inconsolably open door.

And reigns the winter's pregnant silence still; 
No sign of spring, save that the catkins fill, 
And willow stems grow daily red and bright. 
These are days when ancients held a rite 
Of expiation for the old year's ill, 
And prayer to purify the new year's will: 
Fit days, ere yet the spring rains blur the sight, 
Ere yet the bounding blood grows hot with haste, 
And dreaming thoughts grow heavy with a greed 
The ardent summer's joy to have and taste; 
Fit days, to give to last year's losses heed, 
To recon clear the new life's sterner need; 
Fit days, for Feast of Expiation placed!",Sonnet

     To seek thee, God; so streams do show the head;

     A holy thirsty dropsy melts me yet.
     But why should I beg more love, whenas thou
   Dost woo my soul, for hers off'ring all thine,

Here walketh passionless age!""—for there expands
A curious superstition in these lands,

To clairfy the pulse and cloud the mind,
And leave me once again undone, possessed.

Than the first leaf that fell,--this wonder fled.
Altered, estranged, disintegrated, lost.
Nor shall my love avail you in your hour.

Upon that day and wander down the air

But for us, you are the full, the numberless flower,

In your wealth you seem to be wearing gown upon gown
upon a body of nothing but light;
yet each seperate petal is at the same time the negation
of all clothing and the refusal of it.

Your fragrance has been calling its sweetest names
in our direction, for hundreds of years;
suddenly it hangs in the air like fame.

Even so, we have never known what to call it; we guess...
And memory is filled with it unawares
which we prayed for from hours that belong to us.

Beyond the summer's sway, within the jejune park

Obliges Statues in the Frieze of Death
And when this pantomime and Panama of Panorama Fails,
""I'll never speak to you agayne"" -- or waste her panting breath.

And seek to tell the memories he had brought 
From earth of thee, what were most fitly said? 
I know not if the rosy showers shed 
From apple-boughs, or if the soft green wrought 
In fields, or if the robin's call be fraught 
The most with thy delight. Perhaps they read 
Thee best who in the ancient time did say 
Thou wert the sacred month unto the old: 
No blossom blooms upon thy brightest day 
So subtly sweet as memories which unfold 
In aged hearts which in thy sunshine lie, 
To sun themselves once more before they die.",Sonnet

   Oh, oh, you will be sorry for that word! 
   Give back my book and take my kiss instead. 
   Was it my enemy or my friend I heard, 
   ""What a big book for such a little head!"" 
   Come, I will show you now my newest hat, 
   And you may watch me purse my mouth and prink! 
   Oh, I shall love you still, and all of that. 
   I never again shall tell you what I think. 
   I shall be sweet and crafty, soft and sly; 

  You will not catch me reading any more: 

  I shall be called a wife to pattern by; 

  And some day when you knock and push the door, 

  Some sane day, not too bright and not too stormy, 

  I shall be gone, and you may whistle for me. IX9.
   Here is a wound that never will heal, I know, 
   Being wrought not of a dearness and a death, 
   But of a love turned ashes and the breath 
   Gone out of beauty; never again will grow 
   The grass on that scarred acre, though I sow 
   Young seed there yearly and the sky bequeath 
   Its friendly weathers down, far underneath 
   Shall be such bitterness of an old woe. 
   That April should be shattered by a gust, 

  That August should be levelled by a rain, 

  I can endure, and that the lifted dust 

  Of man should settle to the earth again; 

  But that a dream can die, will be a thrust 

  Between my ribs forever of hot pain. XVIII18.
   I, being born a woman and distressed 
   By all the needs and notions of my kind, 
   Am urged by your propinquity to find 
   Your person fair, and feel a certain zest 
   To bear your body's weight upon my breast: 
   So subtly is the fume of life designed, 
   To clarify the pulse and cloud the mind, 
   And leave me once again undone, possessed. 
   Think not for this, however, the poor treason 

  Of my stout blood against my staggering brain, 

  I shall remember you with love, or season 

  My scorn with pity, -- let me make it plain: 

  I find this frenzy insufficient reason 

  For conversation when we meet again. XIX19.
   What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why, 
   I have forgotten, and what arms have lain 
   Under my head till morning; but the rain 
   Is full of ghosts to-night, that tap and sigh 
   Upon the glass and listen for reply, 
   And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain 
   For unremembered lads that not again 
   Will turn to me at midnight with a cry. 
   Thus in the winter stands the lonely tree, 

  Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one, 

  Yet knows its boughs more silent than before: 

  I cannot say what loves have come and gone, 

  I only know that summer sang in me 

  A little while, that in me sings no more.",Sonnet

We drenched the altars of Love's sacred grove,
Shaking to earth green fruits, impatient after
The launching of the colored moths of Love.
Love's proper myrtle and his mother's zone
We bound about our irreligious brows,
And fettered him with garlands of our own,
And spread a banquet in his frugal house.
Not yet the god has spoken; but I fear

Fame, like a wayward girl, will still be coy
To those who woo her with too slavish knees,

And dotes the more upon a heart at ease;
She is a Gypsy,-will not speak to those
Who have not learnt to be content without her;
A Jilt, whose ear was never whisper'd close,
Who thinks they scandal her who talk about her;
A very Gypsy is she, Nilus-born,
Sister-in-law to jealous Potiphar;
Ye love-sick Bards! repay her scorn for scorn;
Ye Artists lovelorn! madmen that ye are!
Make your best bow to her and bid adieu,
Then, if she likes it, she will follow you.

'You cannot eat your cake and have it too.'~Proverb.

How fever'd is the man, who cannot look
Upon his mortal days with temperate blood,
Who vexes all the leaves of his life's book,
And robs his fair name of its maidenhood;
It is as if the rose should pluck herself,
On the ripe plum finger its misty bloom,
As if a Naiad, like a meddling elf,
Should darken her pure grot with muddy gloom:
But the rose leaves herself upon the briar,
For winds to kiss and grateful bees to feed,
And the ripe plum still wears its dim attire,
The undisturbed lake has crystal space;
Why then should man, teasing the world for grace,
Spoil his salvation for a fierce miscreed?",Sonnet

Like wind from an oasis, or the sound

Firm faith in your abundance, whom I found
Long since to be but just one other mound
Of sand, whereon no green thing ever grew.
And once again, and wiser in no wise,
I chase your colored phantom on the air,
And sob and curse and fall and weep and rise
And stumble pitifully on to where,
Miserable and lost, with stinging eyes,
Once more I clasp,—and there is nothing there.",Sonnet

As men have loved their lovers in times past
And sung their wit, their virtue and their grace,
So have we loved sweet Justice to the last,
That now lies here in an unseemly place.
The child will quit the cradle and grow wise
And stare on beauty till his senses drown;
Yet shall be seen no more by mortal eyes
Such beauty as here walked and here went down.
Like birds that hear the winter crying plain
Her courtiers leave to seek the clement south;
Many have praised her, we alone remain
To break a fist against the lying mouth
Of any man who says this was not so:
Though she be dead now, as indeed we know.

II

Where can the heart be hidden in the ground
And be at peace, and be at peace forever,
Under the world, untroubled by the sound
Of mortal tears, that cease from pouring never?
Well for the heart, by stern compassion harried,
If death be deeper than the churchmen say, --
Gone from this world indeed what's graveward carried,
And laid to rest indeed what's laid away.
Anguish enough while yet the indignant breather
Have blood to spurt upon the oppressor's hand;
Who would eternal be, and hang in ether
A stuffless ghost above his struggling land,
Retching in vain to render up the groan
That is not there, being aching dust's alone?",Sonnet

The Singing Mountain's memory, and betray
The silent lyre that hangs upon me yet?
Ah, but indeed, some day shall you awake,

Marvel him crying on a name that was,—
So is it now with me in my distress.
Your body was a temple to Delight;
Cold are its ashes whence the breath is fled,
Yet here one time your spirit was wont to move;
Here might I hope to find you day or night,

Just as I wonder at the twofold screen 
Of twisted innocence that you would plait 
For eyes that uncourageously await 
The coming of a kingdom that has been, 
So do I wonder what God’s love can mean
To you that all so strangely estimate 
The purpose and the consequent estate 
Of one short shuddering step to the Unseen. 

No, I have not your backward faith to shrink 
Lone-faring from the doorway of God’s home
To find Him in the names of buried men; 
Nor your ingenious recreance to think 
We cherish, in the life that is to come, 
The scattered features of dead friends again.

Never until our souls are strong enough
To plunge into the crater of the Scheme— 
Triumphant in the flash there to redeem 
Love’s handsel and forevermore to slough, 
Like cerements at a played-out masque, the rough 
And reptile skins of us whereon we set 
The stigma of scared years—are we to get 
Where atoms and the ages are one stuff. 

Nor ever shall we know the cursed waste 
Of life in the beneficence divine 
Of starlight and of sunlight and soul-shine
That we have squandered in sin’s frail distress, 
Till we have drunk, and trembled at the taste, 
The mead of Thought’s prophetic endlessness.",Sonnet
57,George William Lewis Marshal ..,"THY verse is like a cool and shady well   
 Lying a-dream within some moss-walled close   
 Far from the common way, where violets doze   
In green-deep grass beside the sweet hare-bell.   
 
And each wayfarer as he stoopeth there           
 Doth spy a face that is most like his own,   
 So weary and—ah me!—so woe-begone   
That almost he forgetteth his deep care.   
 
There is a royal restraint in thy sad rhyme,   
 Dis-calmèd calm, and passion passionless,           
 And mellowed is all taint of bitterness   
Into the harmony of that still time   
 
When leaves are yellowing in the sallow sun   
 And evening’s bloom is flush across the sky,   
When haggard summer tottereth in his run           
 And gracious moist-eyed autumn draweth nigh.   
 
O king! majestical in thy decline   
As in thy Spring,—might such an end be mine!",Sonnet
58,Dante Gabriel Rossetti,"I

I sat with Love upon a woodside well,
Leaning across the water, I and he;
Nor ever did he speak nor looked at me,
But touched his lute wherein was audible
The certain secret thing he had to tell:
Only our mirrored eyes met silently
In the low wave; and that sound came to be
The passionate voice I knew; and my tears fell.
And at their fall, his eyes beneath grew hers;
And with his foot and with his wing-feathers
He swept the spring that watered my heart's drouth.
Then the dark ripples spread to waving hair,
And as I stooped, her own lips rising there
Bubbled with brimming kisses at my mouth.


II

And now Love sang: but his was such a song,
So meshed with half-remembrance hard to free,
As souls disused in death's sterility
May sing when the new birthday tarries long.
And I was made aware of a dumb throng
That stood aloof, one form by every tree,
All mournful forms, for each was I or she,
The shades of those our days that had no tongue.
They looked on us, and knew us and were known;
While fast together, alive from the abyss,
Clung the soul-wrung implacable close kiss;
And pity of self through all made broken moan
Which said “For once, for once, for once alone!”
And still Love sang, and what he sang was this:—


III

“O Ye, all ye that walk in Willowwood,
That walk with hollow faces burning white;
What fathom-depth of soul-struck widowhood,
What long, what longer hours, one lifelong night,
Ere ye again, who so in vain have wooed
Your last hope lost, who so in vain invite
Your lips to that their unforgotten food,
Ere ye, ere ye again shall see the light!
Alas! the bitter banks in Willowwood,
With tear-spurge wan, with blood-wort burning red:
Alas! if ever such a pillow could
Steep deep the soul in sleep till she were dead,—
Better all life forget her than this thing,
That Willowwood should hold her wandering!”

IV

So sang he: and as meeting rose and rose
Together cling through the wind's wellaway
Nor change at once, yet near the end of day
The leaves drop loosened where the heart-stain glows,—
So when the song died did the kiss unclose;
And her face fell back drowned, and was as grey
As its grey eyes; and if it ever may
Meet mine again I know not if Love knows.
Only I know that I leaned low and drank
A long draught from the water where she sank,
Her breath and all her tears and all her soul:
And as I leaned, I know I felt Love's face
Pressed on my neck with moan of pity and grace,
Till both our heads were in his aureole.",Sonnet
61,Dante Gabriel Rossetti,"I. ST. LUKE THE PAINTER

Give honour unto Luke Evangelist;
For he it was (the aged legends say)
Who first taught Art to fold her hands and pray.
Scarcely at once she dared to rend the mist
Of devious symbols: but soon having wist
How sky-breadth and field-silence and this day
Are symbols also in some deeper way,
She looked through these to God and was God's priest.
And if, past noon, her toil began to irk,
And she sought talismans, and turned in vain
To soulless self-reflections of man's skill,—
Yet now, in this the twilight, she might still
Kneel in the latter grass to pray again,
Ere the night cometh and she may not work.


II. NOT AS THESE

'I am not as these are,” the poet saith
In youth's pride, and the painter, among men
At bay, where never pencil comes nor pen,
And shut about with his own frozen breath.
To others for whom only rhyme wins faith
As poets,—only paint as painters,—then
He turns in the cold silence; and again
Shrinking, “I am not as these are,” he saith.
And say that this is so, what follows it?
For were thine eyes set backwards in thine head,
Such words were well; but they see on, and far.
Unto the lights of the great Past, new-lit
Fair for the Future's track, look thou instead,—
Say thou instead, “I am not as these are.”


III. THE HUSBANDMEN

Though God, as one that is an householder,
Called these to labour in His vineyard first,
Before the husk of darkness was well burst
Bidding them grope their way out and bestir,
(Who, questioned of their wages, answered, “Sir,
Unto each man a penny:”) though the worst
Burthen of heat was theirs and the dry thirst:
Though God has since found none such as these were
To do their work like them:—Because of this
Stand not ye idle in the market-place.
Which of ye knoweth he is not that last
Who may be first by faith and will?—yea, his
The hand which after the appointed days
And hours shall give a Future to their Past?",Sonnet
64,Michael Drayton,"Into these Loves who but for Passion looks, 
At this first sight here let him lay them by 
And seek elsewhere, in turning other books, 
Which better may his labor satisfy. 
No far-fetch'd sigh shall ever wound my breast, 
Love from mine eye a tear shall never wring, 
Nor in Ah me's my whining sonnets drest; 
A libertine, fantasticly I sing. 
My verse is the true image of my mind, 
Ever in motion, still desiring change, 
And as thus to variety inclin'd, 
So in all humours sportively I range. 
My Muse is rightly of the English strain, 
That cannot long one fashion entertain.",Sonnet
69,Dante Gabriel Rossetti,"I
Beholding youth and hope in mockery caught
From life; and mocking pulses that remain
When the soul's death of bodily death is fain;
Honour unknown, and honour known unsought;
And penury's sedulous self-torturing thought
On gold, whose master therewith buys his bane;
And longed-for woman longing all in vain
For lonely man with love's desire distraught;
And wealth, and strength, and power, and pleasantness,
Given unto bodies of whose souls men say,
None poor and weak, slavish and foul, as they:—
Beholding these things, I behold no less
The blushing morn and blushing eve confess
The shame that loads the intolerable day.

II
As some true chief of men, bowed down with stress
Of life's disastrous eld, on blossoming youth
May gaze, and murmur with self-pity and ruth,—
“Might I thy fruitless treasure but possess,
Such blessing of mine all coming years should bless;”—
Then sends one sigh forth to the unknown goal,
And bitterly feels breathe against his soul
The hour swift-winged of nearer nothingness:—
Even so the World's grey Soul to the green World
Perchance one hour must cry: “Woe's me, for whom
Inveteracy of ill portends the doom,—
Whose heart's old fire in shadow of shame is furl'd:
While thou even as of yore art journeying,
All soulless now, yet merry with the Spring!”",Sonnet
70,Dante Gabriel Rossetti,"I. HERSELF

To be a sweetness more desired than Spring;
A bodily beauty more acceptable
Than the wild rose-tree's arch that crowns the fell;
To be an essence more environing
Than wine's drained juice; a music ravishing
More than the passionate pulse of Philomel;—
To be all this 'neath one soft bosom's swell
That is the flower of life:—how strange a thing!
How strange a thing to be what Man can know
But as a sacred secret! Heaven's own screen
Hides her soul's purest depth and loveliest glow;
Closely withheld, as all things most unseen,—
The wave-bowered pearl,—the heart-shaped seal of green
That flecks the snowdrop underneath the snow.


II. HER LOVE

She loves him; for her infinite soul is Love,
And he her lodestar. Passion in her is
A glass facing his fire, where the bright bliss
Is mirrored, and the heat returned. Yet move
That glass, a stranger's amorous flame to prove,
And it shall turn, by instant contraries,
Ice to the moon; while her pure fire to his
For whom it burns, clings close i' the heart's alcove.
Lo! they are one. With wifely breast to breast
And circling arms, she welcomes all command
Of love,—her soul to answering ardours fann'd:
Yet as morn springs or twilight sinks to rest,
Ah! who shall say she deems not loveliest
The hour of sisterly sweet hand-in-hand?

III. HER HEAVEN

If to grow old in Heaven is to grow young,
(As the Seer saw and said,) then blest were he
With youth for evermore, whose heaven should be
True Woman, she whom these weak notes have sung.
Here and hereafter,—choir-strains of her tongue,—
Sky-spaces of her eyes,—sweet signs that flee
About her soul's immediate sanctuary,—
Were Paradise all uttermost worlds among.
The sunrise blooms and withers on the hill
Like any hillflower; and the noblest troth
Dies here to dust. Yet shall Heaven's promise clothe
Even yet those lovers who have cherished still
This test for love:—in every kiss sealed fast
To feel the first kiss and forebode the last.",Sonnet
75,Dante Gabriel Rossetti,"I
Eat thou and drink; to-morrow thou shalt die.
Surely the earth, that's wise being very old,
Needs not our help. Then loose me, love, and hold
Thy sultry hair up from my face; that I
May pour for thee this golden wine, brim-high,
Till round the glass thy fingers glow like gold.
We'll drown all hours: thy song, while hours are toll'd,
Shall leap, as fountains veil the changing sky.
Now kiss, and think that there are really those,
My own high-bosomed beauty, who increase
Vain gold, vain lore, and yet might choose our way!
Through many years they toil; then on a day
They die not,—for their life was death,—but cease;
And round their narrow lips the mould falls close.

II
Watch thou and fear; to-morrow thou shalt die.
Or art thou sure thou shalt have time for death?
Is not the day which God's word promiseth
To come man knows not when? In yonder sky,
Now while we speak, the sun speeds forth: can I
Or thou assure him of his goal? God's breath
Even at this moment haply quickeneth
The air to a flame; till spirits, always nigh
Though screened and hid, shall walk the daylight here.
And dost thou prate of all that man shall do?
Canst thou, who hast but plagues, presume to be
Glad in his gladness that comes after thee?
Will his strength slay thy worm in Hell? Go to:
Cover thy countenance, and watch, and fear.

III
Think thou and act; to-morrow thou shalt die.
Outstretched in the sun's warmth upon the shore,
Thou say'st: “Man's measured path is all gone o'er:
Up all his years, steeply, with strain and sigh,
Man clomb until he touched the truth; and I,
Even I, am he whom it was destined for.”
How should this be? Art thou then so much more
Than they who sowed, that thou shouldst reap thereby?
Nay, come up hither. From this wave-washed mound
Unto the furthest flood-brim look with me;
Then reach on with thy thought till it be drown'd.
Miles and miles distant though the last line be,
And though thy soul sail leagues and leagues beyond,—
Still, leagues beyond those leagues, there is more sea.",Sonnet
76,Charles Hamilton Sorley,"I

Poets have whitened at your high renown.   
We stand among the many millions who

To live as of your presence unaware.   
But now in every road on every side

83,Francis Thompson,"I
The heart you hold too small and local thing,
Such spacious terms of edifice to bear.
And yet, since Poesy first shook out her wing,
The mighty Love has been impalaced there;
That has she given him as his wide demesne,
And for his sceptre ample empery;
Against its door to knock has Beauty been
Content; it has its purple canopy
A dais for the sovereign lady spread
Of many a lover, who the heaven would think
Too low an awning for her sacred head.
The world, from star to sea, cast down its brink--
Yet shall that chasm, till He Who these did build
An awful Curtius make Him, yawn unfilled.

O nothing, in this corporal earth of man,
That to the imminent heaven of his high soul
Responds with colour and with shadow, can
Lack correlated greatness. If the scroll
Where thoughts lie fast in spell of hieroglyph
Be mighty through its mighty habitants;
If God be in His Name; grave potence if
The sounds unbind of hieratic chants;
All's vast that vastness means. Nay, I affirm
Nature is whole in her least things exprest,
Nor know we with what scope God builds the worm.
Our towns are copied fragments from our breast;
And all man's Babylons strive but to impart
The grandeurs of his Babylonian heart.",Sonnet
84,Wilfrid Scawen Blunt,"Should ever the day come when this drear world
Shall read the secret which so close I hold,
Should taunts and jeers at my bowed head be hurled,
And all my love and all my shame be told,
I could not, as some doughtier women do,
Fling jests and gold and live the scandal down,
Nor, knowing all fame's bruitings to be true,
Keep a proud face and brave the talk of town.
I have no courage for such tricks and ways,
No wish to flaunt a once well--honoured name.
I have too dear a thought of earlier days,
Too deep a dread of my deserved shame.
So, when it comes, with one last suppliant cry
For pardon from my wronged ones, I must die.",Sonnet

Chins that might serve the new Jerusalem; 
Streets footsore; minute whisking milliners, 
Dubbed graceful, but at whom one's eye demurs, 
Knowing of England; ladies, much the same; 
Bland smiling dogs with manes—a few of them 
At pains to look like sporting characters; 
Vast humming tabbies smothered in their furs; 
Groseille, orgeat, meringues à la crême— 
Good things to study; ditto bad—the maps 
Of sloshy colour in the Louvre; cinq-francs 
The largest coin; and at the restaurants 
Large Ibrahim Pachas in Turkish caps 
To pocket them. Un million d'habitants: 
Cast up, they'll make an Englishman—perhaps.

Tiled floors in bedrooms; trees (now run to seed— 
Such seed as the wind takes) of Liberty; 
Squares with new names that no one seems to see; 
Scrambling Briarean passages, which lead 
To the first place you came from; urgent need 
Of unperturbed nasal philosophy; 
Through Paris (what with church and gallery) 
Some forty first-rate paintings,—or indeed 
Fifty mayhap; fine churches; splendid inns; 
Fierce sentinels (toy-size without the stands) 
Who spit their oaths at you and grind their r's 
If at a fountain you would wash your hands; 
One Frenchman (this is fact) who thinks he spars:— 
Can even good dinners cover all these sins?

Yet in the mighty French metropolis 
Our time has not gone from us utterly 
In waste. The wise man saith, “An ample fee 
For toil, to work thine end.” Aye that it is. 
Should England ask, “Was narrow prejudice 
Stretched to its utmost point unflinchingly, 
Even unto lying, at all times, by ye?” 
We can say firmly: “Lord, thou knowest this, 
Our soil may own us.” Having but small French, 
Hunt passed for a stern Spartan all the while, 
Uncompromising, of few words: for me— 
I think I was accounted generally 
A fool, and just a little cracked. Thy smile 
May light on us, Britannia, healthy wench.",Sonnet

AT threescore years and five aroused anew
To rule in India, forth a soldier went
On whose bright-fronted youth fierce war had spent
Its iron stress of storm, till glory grew
Full as the red sun waned on Waterloo.
Landing, he met the word from England sent
Which bade him yield up rule: and he, content,
Resigned it, as a mightier warrior’s due;
And wrote as one rejoicing to record
That ‘from the first’ his royal heart was lord
Of its own pride or pain; that thought was none
Therein save this, that in her perilous strait
England, whose womb brings forth her sons so great,
Should choose to serve her first her mightiest son.

II.

Glory beyond all flight of warlike fame
Go with the warrior’s memory who preferred
To praise of men whereby men’s hearts are stirred,
And acclamation of his own proud name
With blare of trumpet-blasts and sound and flame
Of pageant honour, and the titular word
That only wins men worship of the herd,
His country’s sovereign good: who overcame
Pride, wrath, and hope of all high chance on earth,
For this land’s love that gave his great heart birth.
O nursling of the sea-winds and the sea,
Immortal England, goddess ocean-born,
What shall thy children fear, what strengths not scorn,
While children of such mould are born to thee?",Sonnet
87,Algernon Charles Swinburne,"NOT ALL disgraced, in that Italian town,
The imperial German cowered beneath thine hand,
Alone indeed imperial Hildebrand,
And felt thy foot and Rome’s, and felt her frown
And thine, more strong and sovereign than his crown,
Though iron forged its blood-encrusted band.
But now the princely wielder of his land,
For hatred’s sake toward freedom, so bows down,
No strength is in the foot to spurn: its tread
Can bruise not now the proud submitted head:
But how much more abased, much lower brought low,
And more intolerably humiliated,
The neck submissive of the prosperous foe,
Than his whom scorn saw shuddering in the snow!",Sonnet
89,Wilfrid Scawen Blunt,"Love, ere I go, forgive me each least wrong,
Each trouble I unwittingly have wrought.
My heart, my life, my tears to thee belong;
Yet have I erred, maybe, through too fond thought.
One sin, most certainly, I need to atone:
The sin of loving thee while yet unwooed.
Mine only was this wrong, this guilt alone.
The woman tempted thee from ways of good.
Forgive me too, ere thy dear pity cease,
That I denied thee, vexed thee with delay,
Sought my soul's coward shelter, not thy peace,
And having won thee still awhile said nay.
Forgive me this, that I too soon, too late,
Too wholly gave a love disconsolate.",Sonnet
90,Algernon Charles Swinburne,"TWO SOULS diverse out of our human sight
Pass, followed one with love and each with wonder:
The stormy sophist with his mouth of thunder,
Clothed with loud words and mantled in the might
Of darkness and magnificence of night;
And one whose eye could smite the night in sunder,
Searching if light or no light were thereunder,
And found in love of loving-kindness light.
Duty divine and Thought with eyes of fire
Still following Righteousness with deep desire
Shone sole and stern before her and above,
Sure stars and sole to steer by; but more sweet
Shone lower the loveliest lamp for earthly feet,
The light of little children, and their love.",Sonnet
91,Wilfrid Scawen Blunt,"What have I lost? The faith I had that Right
Must surely prove itself than Ill more strong.
For see how little my poor prayers had might
To save me, at the trial's pinch, from wrong.
What have I lost? The truth of my proud eyes
Scorning deceit. Behold me here to--day
Leading a double life, at shifts with lies,
And trembling lest each shadow should betray.
No longer with my lost ones may I mourn,
Who came to me in sleep and breathed soft words.
Sleepless I lie and fearful and forlorn,
With their love's edge still wounding like a sword's.
In thy dear presence only I find rest.
To thee alone naught needs to be confessed.",Sonnet
92,Wilfrid Scawen Blunt,"Wild words I write, and lettered in deep pain,
To lay in your loved hand as love's farewell.
It is the thought we shall not meet again
Nerves me to write and my whole secret tell.
For when I speak to you, you only jest,
And laughing break the sentence with a kiss,
Till my poor love is never quite confessed,
Nor know you half its tears and tenderness.
When the first darkness and the clouds began
I hid it from you fearing your reproof;
I would not vex your life's high aim and plan
With my poor woman's woe, and held aloof.
But now that all is ended, pride and shame,
My tumults and my joys I may proclaim.",Sonnet
93,Wilfrid Scawen Blunt,"'Tis ended truly, truly as was best.
Love is a little thing, for one short day;
You could not make it your life's only quest,
Nor watch the poor corpse long in its decay.
Go forth, dear, thou hast much to do on earth;
In life's campaign there waits thee a great part,
Much to be won and conquered of more worth
Than this poor victory of a woman's heart.
For me the daylight of my years is dim.
I seek not gladness, yet shall find content
In such small duties as are learned of Him
Who bore all sorrows, till my youth is spent.
Yet come what may to me of weal or woe,
I love thee, bless thee, dear, where'er thou go.",Sonnet
94,Wilfrid Scawen Blunt,"The day draws nigh, methinks, when I could stay
Calm in thy presence with no dream of ill,
When, having put all earthliness away,
I could be near thee, touching thee, and still
Feel no mad throbbing at my foolish heart,
No sudden rising of unbidden tears,
Could mark thee come and go, to meet our part,
Without the gladness and without the fears.
Have patience with me then for this short space.
I shall be wise, but may not yet unmoved
See a strange woman put into my place
And happy in thy love, as I was loved:
This were too much. Ah, let me not yet see
The love--light in thine eyes, and not for me.",Sonnet
95,Wilfrid Scawen Blunt,"Whate'er the cost to me, with this farewell,
I shall not see thee, speak to thee again.
If some on Earth must feel the pangs of Hell,
Mine only be it who have earned my pain.
No matter if my life be blank and dead,
Bankrupt of pleasure: it is better so
Than risk dishonour on a once loved head,
Than link all loved ones with my own sole woe.
I have no claim to bring grief's shade on these,
To mix their pure life's waters with my wine,
To vex the dead, dear dead, in their new peace
With knowledge of my sin and great decline.
For these I leave thee, and, though life be rent
With the rude fight, think not I shall relent.",Sonnet
96,Wilfrid Scawen Blunt,"If the past year were offered me again,
With choice of good and ill before me set.
Should I be wiser for the bliss and pain
And dare to choose that we had never met?
Could I find heart those happy hours to miss,
When love began unthought of and unspoke
That first strange day when by a sudden kiss
We knew each other's secret and awoke?
Ah, no! not even to escape the smart
Of that fell agony I underwent,
Flying from thee and my own traitor heart,
Till doubts and dreads and battlings overspent,
I knew at last that thou or love or fate
Had conquered and repentance was too late.",Sonnet
97,Wilfrid Scawen Blunt,"Nay, dear one, ask me not to leave thee yet.
Let me a little longer hold thy hand.
Too soon it is to bid me to forget
The joys I was so late to understand.
The future holds but a blank face for me,
The past is all confused with tears and grey,
But the sweet present, while thy smiles I see,
Is perfect sunlight, an unclouded day.
Speak not of parting, not at least this hour,
Though well I know Love cannot Time outlast.
Let me grow wiser first and gain more power,
More strength of will to deal with my dead past.
Love me in silence still, one short hour's space:
'Tis all I ask of thee, this little grace.",Sonnet
98,Wilfrid Scawen Blunt,"Where is the pride for which I once was blamed,
My vanity which held its head so high?
Who would believe them, seeing me thus tamed,
Thus subject, here as at thy feet I lie,
Pleading for love which now is all my life,
Craving a word for memory's rage to keep,
Asking a sign to still my inward strife,
Petitioning a touch to soothe my sleep?
Who would now guess them, as I kiss the ground
On which the feet of him I love have trod,
And bow before his voice whose least sweet sound
Speaks louder to me than the voice of God;
And knowing all the while that one dark day,
Spite of my worship, thou wilt turn away?",Sonnet
99,Wilfrid Scawen Blunt,"I sue thee not for pity on my case.
If I have sinned, the judgment has begun.
My joy was but one day of all the days,
And clouds have blotted it and hid the sun.
Thou wert so much to me! But soon I knew
How small a part could mine be in thy life,
That all a woman may endure or do
Counts little to her hero in the strife.
I do not blame thee who deserved no blame;
Thou hast so many worlds within thy ken.
I staked my all upon a losing game,
Knowing the nature and the needs of men,
And knowing too how quickly pride is spent.
With open eyes to Love and Death I went.",Sonnet
